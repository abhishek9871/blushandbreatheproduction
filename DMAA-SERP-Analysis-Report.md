## 🎯 CONTENT STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Authority Positioning
**Challenge:** Government and medical sites dominate. No commercial/blog site ranks in top 3 for any query.

**Strategy:**
- Position as educational/safety resource, NOT commercial
- Include extensive citations to FDA, WADA, NIH sources
- Display medical disclaimers prominently
- Consider .org domain if creating standalone resource

### 2. Regional Content Opportunities
**Opportunity:** Country-specific pages for Australia, Canada, UK, EU regulations.

**Content Ideas:**
- "Is DMAA Legal in Australia? [2025 TGA Guidelines]"
- "DMAA UK Law: What the MHRA Says"
- "DMAA Canada: Health Canada's Position"

### 3. Comparison Content
**Opportunity:** "DMAA vs DMHA" shows demand for comparison content.

**Content Ideas:**
- DMAA vs DMHA: Complete Comparison
- DMAA vs Caffeine: Stimulant Showdown
- DMAA vs Ephedrine: Historical Analysis

### 4. Q&A/FAQ Optimization
**Pattern:** "People Also Ask" questions repeat across queries.

**Must-Answer Questions:**
1. Will DMAA show up on a drug test?
2. Why is DMAA banned by WADA?
3. Is DMAA like caffeine?
4. Is DMAA banned in powerlifting?
5. What is a substitute for DMAA?
6. Is DMHA legal or illegal?
7. Is geranium the same as DMAA?
8. Is DMAE the same as DMAA?

### 5. Research Chemical Angle
**Opportunity:** Chemical supplier content ranks well for research queries.

**Caution:** This is grey area legally - focus on educational content about chemical properties, NOT purchasing guidance.

### 6. Reddit Integration
**Pattern:** Reddit dominates for user discussion queries.

**Strategy:**
- Monitor relevant subreddits (r/Fitness, r/Supplements, r/preworkout)
- Create content that addresses common Reddit questions
- Consider Reddit as traffic/backlink source
