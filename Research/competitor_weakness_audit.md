## Final Verdict

| Market | Verdict | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **BE (berberine kopen belgie)** | **GO - HIGH CONFIDENCE** | Create buying guide immediately |
| **NL (berberine ervaringen)** | **GO - MEDIUM-HIGH CONFIDENCE** | Create experience/review guide |
| **FR (berbérine avis perte de poids)** | **GO - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE** | Create balanced guide, expect longer ranking time |

**Bottom Line:** The competition is weak enough to beat. The top results either:
1. WARN users (consumer associations) but don't help them buy
2. SELL products (e-commerce) but don't guide the purchase decision
3. PROMOTE their own services (medical clinics) rather than berberine

**Our content can fill the gap:** Genuine, helpful buying guides that help users make informed decisions.
