### Content Gaps Identified

**What's missing from current top 3:**

1. **Gap 1: No comprehensive comparison table** — Current results don't compare D-Bal Max vs D-Bal vs other alternatives side-by-side
2. **Gap 2: No real user testimonials** — Lacking authentic before/after stories or verified reviews
3. **Gap 3: No dosage/cycle guide** — Missing practical "how to use" information for beginners
4. **Gap 4: No India-specific pricing** — Search suggests demand for India pricing ("D-Bal Max price in India")
5. **Gap 5: No ingredient deep-dive** — Superficial coverage of what's actually in the product

**Our competitive advantage:**
We can create the definitive D-Bal Max guide with ingredient analysis, dosage protocols, real results expectations, comparison tables, and India-specific purchasing info — all in one comprehensive resource.
