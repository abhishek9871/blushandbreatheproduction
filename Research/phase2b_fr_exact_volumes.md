## Summary

### Volume Distribution:
- **Keywords with >100 searches/month:** 0
- **Keywords with 10-100 searches/month:** 0
- **Keywords with 0 or no data:** 7 (100%)

### Key Observations:

1. **All 7 French keywords returned NO DATA from GKP**
   - This indicates search volumes are below GKP's reporting threshold (typically <10-50/month)
   - OR these specific long-tail phrase combinations aren't tracked by GKP

2. **Possible Explanations:**
   - French berberine + Ozempic niche is very specific/emerging
   - Users may search with different phrase variations
   - Keywords may be too long-tail for GKP detection
   - The topic is relatively new in French-speaking markets

3. **Implications for Validation:**
   - GKP cannot validate these keywords' volumes
   - Must rely on Ahrefs and KWFinder for cross-validation
   - Phase 1 volume estimates may have been based on:
     - SERP analysis indicating demand
     - Related keyword inference
     - Competitor content presence

4. **Recommendations:**
   - Proceed to Ahrefs validation (Phase 2D)
   - Consider testing shorter/broader variations:
     - "berbérine france"
     - "acheter berbérine"
     - "ozempic naturel"
   - If Ahrefs also shows low/no data, prioritize based on:
     - Commercial intent signals from SERPs
     - Competitor analysis from Phase 1
     - Low competition = easy ranking opportunity
