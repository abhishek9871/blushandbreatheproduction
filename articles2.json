I wasn’t in a good place. It was about more than what happened in that match. There’s a lot that people didn’t and don’t know about.”</p> \n<p>Shaw is speaking for the first time about her decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/06/khadija-shaw-pulls-out-manchester-city-league-cup-semi-final-arsenal-after-abuse\">withdraw from Manchester City’s League Cup semi-final against Arsenal</a> in February, four days after she had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/05/manchester-city-condemn-vile-individuals-over-bunny-shaw-abuse\">suffered horrific racist abuse</a> following a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/02/womens-super-league-wsl-manchester-city-arsenal-match-report\">4-3 loss against the same side</a> in the Women’s Super League. Manchester City said they were “appalled” and reported the matter to the police.</p> \n<p>“It was pretty scary to some extent,” adds Shaw, the WSL top scorer in the past two seasons. “But I’m lucky enough to have my family, my friends and those that care about me close. They’ve been there and supported me and helped me throughout that tough period.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"80a0d5da-3f62-4dd9-b2c9-a3e697b70495\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A second man has been arrested by police investigating online racist abuse sent to England defender Jess Carter during the Women's Euros.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Derbyshire constabulary arrested a 30-year-old man from Ripley on suspicion of malicious communications in relation to the abuse towards Carter.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The man has been released on bail.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It followed the arrest of a 59-year-old man from Great Harwood by Lancashire police on August 28, also on suspicion of malicious communication in relation to some of the messages.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Both arrests stem from an investigation launched in July by the UK Football Policing Unit (UKFPU) and social media companies. <b>PA Media</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Jamaica international wants to see more done to protect players, particularly female players, who don’t have the same levels of security or representatives to run social media accounts for them as male players do.</p> \n<p>“There needs to be a lot more accountability as well because we can only talk for so much,” says Shaw. “We can do our actions on the pitch but if it’s the same cycle of abuse over and over again then they’ll feel they can always get away with it. We need the higher-ups to do something about it because otherwise year on year on year we’re going to see more of the same.”</p> \n<p>Shaw, the human at the centre of the storm, is not ready to talk about the details of what she faced or where her head was at, and there should be no pressure on her to ever have to do so. Sitting at a table set up on the astro of City’s indoor pitch, Shaw shares the frustration that the onus is on her, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/20/england-lionesses-condemn-racist-online-abuse-jess-carter-euro-2025\">Jess Carter</a>, or other Black players, to speak up on racism. “It’s not right,” she says. “There was more to it all than what the vast majority knew and, when I have time and when it’s right, I’m definitely going to speak on it. For now I just want to focus on the season and the first game.”</p> \n<p>Ambitions for the new season are high. Last campaign, with a disappointing City side crippled by injuries and a little rudderless, Gareth Taylor was sacked on the eve of four back-to-back games against the eventual treble winners, Chelsea. City’s former manager Nick Cushing stepped in but they finished trophyless and fourth in the WSL table, one point behind Manchester United, missing out on Champions League qualification.</p> \n<p>Andrée Jeglertz, who was in charge of Denmark at the Euros, is the coach charged with guiding them through their next phase. Sometimes change, regardless of what it is, is needed. “100%,” says Shaw. “You find that we have energy we didn’t have before. For whatever reason, I don’t understand why. The energy has definitely been different and definitely been better, possibly because it’s new and we don’t know what to expect. That drives the training more every day.”</p> \n<p>The Swedish coach has been clear about what he wants to see. “He’s made it known from the get-go exactly what he wants from this group,” says Shaw. “He told us that he’s not trying to change us dramatically as players. We’re just trying to grasp the information and implement it as best as possible on the pitch to ensure when the first game comes, we are at least at a level to go out and perform at our best.”</p> \n<p>Shaw was one of the many City players sidelined last season, with a foot injury meaning she started only 10 league games. Despite that she shared the golden boot with Arsenal’s Alessia Russo, having scored 12 goals before her injury.</p> \n<p><em>“</em>It was definitely my weakest season,” she says. “I started the season really well and unfortunately I had an injury that was out of my control, a fractured foot. Can’t really do much with that. I didn’t know I’d won the golden boot until the last day, on the pitch when they announced it, because that was nowhere in my thought. I was mentally not in a good place because I knew I couldn’t help the team the way I wanted to; as a player that’s what you want to be able to do, to be available for every game.”</p> \n<p>The small silver lining to the injury was the chance to rest body and mind after a lot of football. “Jamaica isn’t close either,” she says. “Having to travel all that way back and forth is difficult, especially when you come back and have to play every three or four days. I was tired. Come November I’d played every game, I was definitely tired. Physically and mentally it can be a lot.”</p> \n<p>Now, though, the 28-year-old is feeling refreshed going into the new campaign. “Body’s feeling good, I feel positive and mentally I’m in a good place,” she says. She is also looking forward to developing her on-pitch relationship with Vivianne Miedema, which was only glimpsed last season.</p> \n<p>“We spoke about it and I think we only played three full games together, which is crazy,” says Shaw. “We’re both in a good place at the moment, so it’s just about building now and then coming into the season, hopefully we’re ready.”</p> \n<p>The pair will strike fear into the heart of every defence in the league, starting with Chelsea in the WSL opener at Stamford Bridge on Friday. Shaw is dismissive of the narrative last summer that questioned whether they could play together. “I definitely say we can play&nbsp;together, I don’t know why people questioned who will start. Viv is not just a goalscorer, she can also assist goals, she likes playing in the No 10.”</p> \n<p>The goal this season could not&nbsp;be clearer: win the league. “It’s City&nbsp;we’re talking about,” says Shaw. “The ambition has to be there. It’s always fine margins. Two&nbsp;years ago we lost the league on&nbsp;goal difference. So it’s not like we’re far off.</p> \n<p>“No Champions League is the&nbsp;reality. We’re in this position, we have a game every Sunday and that&nbsp;game should be the most important and that’s how we’re going to attack each game. Ultimately we have no excuse to not go and win the league.”</p>","source":"The Guardian","author":""},{"id":"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cvg43vdk37no?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss","title":"'I didn't tell anyone about my medical cannabis prescription'","description":"More than 50,000 people in the UK each month get a private prescription for medical cannabis.","imageUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/843d/live/90059a90-c131-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg","category":"Health","date":"2025-11-15","content":"More than 50,000 people in the UK each month get a private prescription for medical cannabis.","source":"BBC Health News","author":"BBC Health News"},{"id":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/02/sanatorium-review-ukraine-health-resort-documentary","title":"Sanatorium review – Ukraine health resort guests seek sanctuary amid shelling","description":"Poignant documentary by Irish director Gar O’Rourke peers into a faded Soviet-era institution where visitors search for relief while war grinds on outside","imageUrl":"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5b917ee2994bf3b455d0b552871f951759b2a4b/749_141_995_796/500.jpg","category":"Health","date":"2025-09-02","content":"<p>There is something ever so slightly Martin Parr-like about this documentary, filmed inside a shabby rundown health resort near Odesa, in Ukraine. It’s not the colour palette, which is Soviet-era pale beige, but the images of holidaymakers: elderly men strutting about in thongs and playing ping pong in their vests; retirees of both sexes glad-ragged at the disco. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/aug/24/theres-something-very-interesting-about-boring-martin-parr-on-his-life-in-pictures\">Like Parr’s photos</a>, the images are funny but not unkind; everyone retains their dignity. The director is Irish film-maker Gar O’Rourke, who planned Sanatorium before the war, but filmed it after Russia invaded Ukraine, which adds a layer of melancholy to the guests’ search for health and happiness.</p> <p>The huge Kuyalnik sanatorium is a time warp with its brutalist architecture and institutional interiors. Back in its glory days, people must have come here in their thousands. Now, the place is a little tired: paint peeling off the walls, the ceilings stained by leaks. The health treatments too have a retro feel: mud wraps and electro massage machines. One guest is Natalia, who has brought her single 40-ish son Andriy, hoping to find him a wife. That doesn’t look promising since most of the other guests look old enough to have visited the sanatorium back in the day. Mother and son give the film a lovely moment slow dancing together to George Michael’s Careless Whisper at the disco. Other stories emerge: one woman’s husband was killed on the frontline; a younger guest is a soldier recovering from injuries sustained on the frontline. Another woman is here for help with fertility.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUiGagXfQO0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AUiGagXfQO0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The place is run by the Tony Soprano of hospitality, Dmitriy, a great wardrobe of man who walks around shouting at staff. He is under pressure: the Russians are shelling Odesa and the air raid sirens are going off, visitor numbers are down, guests are glued to their phones, checking the news and apps monitoring drones and missiles. Their resilience is heroic, and there is a very moving scene near the end during a recital of the national anthem; so many faces with tears, each registering a loss or struggle.</p> <p>• Sanatorium is in UK and Irish cinemas from 5 September.</p>","source":"The Guardian","author":""},{"id":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/01/former-cdc-officials-rfk-jr-endangering-americans-health","title":"Former CDC leaders condemn RFK Jr for endangering Americans’ health","description":"In a New York Times essay, nine officials said Kennedy’s leadership at HHS ‘should alarm every American’","imageUrl":"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d00bf09c5c5d36fcf6b427c38563056ecf49b90/0_0_5000_4000/500.jpg","category":"Health","date":"2025-09-01","content":"<p>Nine former officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr\">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>’s leadership of the US health and human services department is “unlike anything our country has ever experienced” and “unacceptable”.

Children are also risking long-term cardiovascular effects as a result of vaping at school and college, experts say.</p> <p>Speaking at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) annual congress in Madrid, the world’s largest heart conference, Prof Maja-Lisa Løchen, a senior cardiologist at the University hospital of North Norway, said she was concerned that millions of children could face ill health in future.</p> <p>She said: “I worry that vaping may be causing irreversible harm to children’s brains and hearts. Of course we have to wait for long-term data, but I am concerned. It increases your blood pressure, your heart rate, and we know that the arteries become more stiff.”</p> <p>Vaping stresses children’s cardiovascular systems, Løchen said. Their heart rate rises and their blood vessels constrict, which can stiffen arteries in the heart over time. Repeatedly vaping can lead to high blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of developing an irregular heart rhythm, stroke and even a heart attack.</p> <p>Løchen cited a study published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine that suggested vaping increases the risk of stroke by almost a third (32%).</p> <p>When e-cigarettes heat liquids to higher temperatures, they can also release larger amounts of harmful chemicals that can flow into the lungs, enter the bloodstream and seep into the heart.</p> <p>The liquids in e-cigarettes can release known carcinogens such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde when heated, research suggests. These and other chemicals can damage blood vessels, drive inflammation and contribute to cardiovascular disease risk.</p> <p>“There is an additional risk of vaping in children [compared with adults] when it comes to effects on the body,” Løchen said. “Because we know that the nicotine and other elements in e-cigarettes have a very harmful effect on developing brains. Not only in the foetus, but during childhood and into your 20s. So that is something we are extremely concerned about.”</p> <p>When children quit vaping, some experience nicotine withdrawal that can increase heart rate and blood pressure, Løchen told reporters after she gave a presentation on e-cigarettes in Madrid.</p> <p>“We also know that when children and young people start vaping, they may become dependent on the nicotine and it can become a gateway to smoking. I’m very worried – and convinced – that children and adolescents that are starting to vape now are at increased risk of irreversible harm to their health.”</p> <p>Also speaking in Madrid, Prof Susanna Price, a consultant cardiologist at Royal Brompton hospital in London and the chair of the ESC advocacy committee, said: “We are seeing an increase in children vaping but what we don’t yet know is what that translates to in long-term cardiovascular risk because they haven’t been around long enough.</p> <p>“I think there is a push to suggest that vaping is safe but we don’t know that. It’s my concern that we’re going to replace one highly addictive substance with another one that may have a similar profile with respect to cardiovascular risk.”</p> <p>Dr Charmaine Griffiths, the chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said: “Vaping is not risk-free and no child or teenager should be picking up an e-cigarette.” She said governments must take action to tackle concerning levels of youth vaping. “Making vaping less appealing to young people and creating a smoke-free generation cannot come a moment too soon.”</p> <p>Data on the long-term health effects is limited because vapes are relatively new and evolving. It could be years before further effects become apparent. In the meantime, Løchen is in favour of a global ban on sales of e-cigarettes. </p> <p>“I think based on what we know now about the detrimental and harmful effects of e-cigarettes, I think there should be a ban on sales of e-cigarettes worldwide,” she said. “There have been around for 15, 20 years now, we have the data. We know they are not harmless.”</p>","source":"The Guardian","author":""},{"id":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/30/therapists-warn-ai-chatbots-mental-health-support","title":"‘Sliding into an abyss’: experts warn over rising use of AI for mental health support","description":"Therapists say they are seeing negative impacts of people increasingly turning to AI chatbots for help","imageUrl":"https://media.guim.co.uk/824cefc46d186f74e8ee47f631504ee1cbb3393b/333_0_3333_2667/500.jpg","category":"Mental Health","date":"2025-08-30","content":"<p>Vulnerable people turning to AI chatbots instead of professional therapists for mental health support could be “sliding into a dangerous abyss”, psychotherapists have warned.</p> <p>Psychotherapists and psychiatrists said they were increasingly seeing negative impacts of AI chatbots being used for mental health, such as fostering emotional dependence, exacerbating anxiety symptoms, self-diagnosis, or amplifying delusional thought patterns, dark thoughts and suicide ideation.</p> <p>Dr Lisa Morrison Coulthard, the director of professional standards, policy and research at the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, said two-thirds of its members expressed concerns about AI therapy in a recent survey.</p> <p>Coulthard said: “Without proper understanding and oversight of AI therapy, we could be sliding into a dangerous abyss in which some of the most important elements of therapy are lost and vulnerable people are in the dark over safety.</p> <p>“We’re worried that although some receive helpful advice, other people may receive misleading or incorrect information about their mental health with potentially dangerous consequences. It’s important to understand that therapy isn’t about giving advice, it’s about offering a safe space where you feel listened to.”</p> <p>Dr Paul Bradley, a specialist adviser on informatics for the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said AI chatbots were “not a substitute for professional mental healthcare nor the vital relationship that doctors build with patients to support their recovery”.</p> <p>He said appropriate safeguards were needed for digital tools to supplement clinical care, and anyone should be able to access talking therapy delivered by a mental health professional, for which greater state funding was needed.</p> <p>“Clinicians have training, supervision and risk-management processes which ensure they provide effective and safe care. So far, freely available digital technologies used outside of existing mental health services are not assessed and held to an equally high standard,” Bradley said.</p> <p>There are signs that companies and policymakers are starting to respond. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/27/chatgpt-scrutiny-family-teen-killed-himself-sue-open-ai\">This week</a> OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, announced plans to change how it responds to users who show emotional distress, after legal action from the family of a teenager who killed himself after months of chatbot conversations. Earlier in August the US state of Illinois became the first local government to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/chicago/2025/08/06/illinois-ai-therapy-ban-mental-health-regulation\">ban AI chatbots</a> from acting as standalone therapists.</p> <p>This comes after emerging evidence of mental health harms. A <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/cmy7n_v3\">preprint study</a> in July reported that AI may amplify delusional or grandiose content in interactions with users vulnerable to psychosis.</p> <p>One of the report’s co-authors, Hamilton Morrin, from King’s College London’s institute of psychiatry, said the use of chatbots to support mental health was “incredibly common”. His research was prompted by encountering people who had developed a psychotic illness at a time of increased chatbot use.</p> <p>He said chatbots undermined an effective treatment for anxiety known as exposure and response prevention, which requires people to face feared situations and avoid safety behaviours. The 24-hour availability of chatbots resulted in a “lack of boundaries” and a “risk of emotional dependence”, he said. “In the short term it alleviates distress but actually it perpetuates the cycle.”</p> <p>Matt Hussey, a BACP-accredited psychotherapist, said he was seeing AI chatbots used in a huge variety of ways, with some clients bringing transcripts into sessions to tell him he was wrong.</p> <p>In particular, people used AI chatbots to self-diagnose conditions such as ADHD or borderline personality disorder, which he said could “quickly shape how someone sees themself and how they expect others to treat them, even if they’re inaccurate”.</p> <p>Hussey added: “Because it’s designed to be positive and affirming, it rarely challenges a poorly framed question or a faulty assumption. Instead, it reinforces the user’s original belief, so they leave the exchange thinking ‘I knew I was right’. That can feel good in the moment but it can also entrench misunderstandings.”</p> <p>Christopher Rolls, a UKCP-accredited psychotherapist, said although he could not disclose information about his clients, he had seen people have “negative experiences”, including conversations that were “inappropriate at best, dangerously alarming at worst”.</p> <p>Rolls said he had heard of people with ADHD or autistic people using chatbots to help with challenging aspects of life. “However, obviously LLMs [large language models] don’t read subtext and all the contextual and non-verbal cues which we as human therapists are aiming to tune into,” he added.</p> <p>He was concerned about clients in their 20s who use chatbots as their “pocket therapist”. “They feel anxious if they don’t consult [chatbots] on basic things like which coffee to buy or what subject to study at college,” he said.</p> <p>“The main risks are around dependence, loneliness and depression that prolonged online relationships can foster,” he said, adding that he was aware of people who had shared dark thoughts with chatbots, which had responded with suicide- and assisted dying-related content.</p> <p>“Basically, it’s the wild west and I think we’re right at the cusp of the full impact and fallout of AI chatbots on mental health,” Rolls said.</p>","source":"The Guardian","author":""},{"id":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgkxj52km4o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss","title":"Wellbeing support for terminally-ill islanders","description":"A hospice offers a free programme for those with life-limiting or serious progressive illnesses.","imageUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/6b85/live/bed9a920-c0b3-11f0-8a6c-bdcd4bb2f081.jpg","category":"Mental Health","date":"2025-11-14","content":"A hospice offers a free programme for those with life-limiting or serious progressive illnesses.","source":"BBC Health News","author":"BBC Health News"},{"id":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/30/porepunkah-shooting-dezi-freeman-victoria-police-deteriorating-mental-health-black-belt-karate-ntwnfb","title":"Suspected Porepunkah gunman Dezi Freeman had deteriorating mental health and a black belt in karate, former friend says","description":"Sending 10 Victoria police officers to execute a warrant on the 56-year-old would have been ‘worst thing’ for Freeman, says man who has known him since the 1990s","imageUrl":"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bfa1dc97e7fddde4b5195df4d88a0ffadd42a8e/166_0_3858_3086/500.jpg","category":"Mental Health","date":"2025-08-30","content":"<p>The suspected Porepunkah gunman has a black belt in karate and is an expert bowhunter, according to a man who has known him since the 1990s.</p> <p>On the fifth day of the manhunt for Dezi Freeman, a former friend has questioned whether police were aware of his deteriorating mental health, suggesting that sending 10 officers to his door to execute a warrant would have been “the worst thing for him”.</p> <p>Freeman, 56, is alleged to have killed two police officers and injured a third on Tuesday in Porepunkah, north-east of Melbourne.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/28/who-is-dezi-freeman-porepunkah-victoria-police-shooting-suspect-sovereign-citizen-ntwnfb\">Who is Dezi Freeman?

That’s because in April, her entire department on preventing gun violence in the US was let go.</p> \n<p>Yet when asked how he would address misinformation leading to violence in the wake of the CDC shooting, Kennedy <a href=\"https://www.scrippsnews.com/health/rfk-jr-in-interview-with-scripps-news-trusting-the-experts-is-not-science\">pointed</a> to past public health officials who he said “have not been honest” about Covid vaccines.</p> \n<p>“An attack on a US government agency should be a moment in time when we come together,” Dr Anne Schuchat, former principal deputy director of the CDC, said in a <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/689f5612fc63c95dc6488b44/t/68a5574c8da0a82c770d2953/1755666253003/HHS+Letter+Press+Release_8amMediaBlast.pdf\">statement</a> about the letter. “Instead, Secretary Kennedy continues to spread misinformation at the risk of American lives.”</p> \n<p>The HHS did not respond by press time to the Guardian’s media inquiries about the role of health officials in promoting misinformation that may lead to violence.</p> \n<p>Employees also called on the NIH director, Jay Bhattacharya, to “refrain from his dangerous politicization of mRNA vaccine technology”.</p> \n<p>The day after the CDC shooting, Bhattacharya <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=IB0H2lJPGIk\">appeared</a> on Steve Bannon’s podcast to push back on what he characterized as health officials’ “relentless propaganda and pressure” to take the mRNA Covid vaccines.</p> \n<p>Bhattacharya spoke about how the former director of the CDC, Rochelle Walensky, was “blinded” to the “facts” of the vaccine, which he said had harmful side effects.</p> \n<p>“As far as public health goes, for vaccines the mRNA platform is no longer viable,” Bhattacharya said.</p> \n<p>It echoed previous statements of his putting the blame for anti-vaccine sentiment on US officials. In July 2024, Bhattacharya <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=2LlfSLKKy-k\">said</a> that people who claimed to be injured by vaccines became “public enemy number one in 2021”, adding they were seen as a “threat” to officials’ efforts to distribute vaccines.</p> \n<p>Last week, Bhattacharya published an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/08/12/nih-mrna-vaccines-jay-bhattacharya/\">op-ed</a> arguing that “mRNA technology has failed to earn the public’s trust”.</p> \n<p>“Within days of the shooting, all of these guys were back out there immediately talking about how dangerous vaccines are,” Carlson said.</p> \n<p>“We see them condemn the violence and act like they had nothing to do with it, and then we also see them repeat the messaging that the shooter believed.”</p> \n<p>Rhetoric about the harms of vaccines, and the alleged dangers posed by health officials, is circulated and amplified in anti-vaccine circles, especially online.</p> \n<p>The man arrested for killing Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in June <a href=\"https://www.theblaze.com/news/exclusive-assassination-suspect-vance-boelter-tells-stunning-inside-story-about-shooting\">told</a> the conservative blog the Blaze that he confronted the couple because he believed the mRNA shots were killing people.</p> \n<p>Violence is the point of decades of anti-vaccine and anti-scientific disinformation – not a byproduct but a tool, Carlson said. Stochastic terrorism, in which public figures use mass media to inspire political violence, has been used to harm trans people and abortion providers, for example, in the past.</p> \n<p>“They’ve learned the comfortable distance between incitement and violence,” Carlson said. “The Maga movement is incredibly good at saying just enough and distributing the burden of incitement within its ecosystem, letting the people at the top set the messaging and then having places like rightwing news outlets and social media sites do the work of amplifying and accelerating and putting violence to the messaging.”</p> \n<p>Removing officials like Kennedy and preventing future violence is “the only path” to restoring trust in public health, Carlson said.</p> \n<p>He added: “This is an existential threat to public health. If we fight and lose, that’s OK, but I would rather fight and lose than lie down.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Every day, a steady stream of patients pours in, while resources are stretched pitifully thin. Through jagged handheld cinematography, Nicolas Peduzzi’s gripping and passionate documentary reflects the facility’s breakneck pace. Amid a flurry of frantic calls and rolling stretchers, a calm presence emerges: here comes Dr Jamal Abdel-Kader, the only staff psychiatrist in the building.</p> <p>The camera trails after Abdel-Kader’s hurried steps as he splits his day between various departments, from the emergency rooms to the intensive care units. Despite his colossal workload – a result of crumbling infrastructure and lack of government budget – he devotes his full attention to each individual patient. Some are only in their late teens when they attempt self-harm and even suicide. Others have already spent a lifetime trapped in a cycle of addiction and depression.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhpk5Lx6ckg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Qhpk5Lx6ckg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Although their situations vary, the patients’ circumstances all point to structural issues in France’s treatment of mental health. Abdel-Kader perceives the private struggles of his patients not simply as personal failings, but as symptoms of an indifferent society, in which people have forgotten how to care for one another. Besides medical intervention, his treatment also includes other forms of therapy, including creative sessions where people gather to study Molière and Shakespeare.</p> <p>Abdel-Kader’s conversations with colleagues reveal that the loneliness endured by the patients also extends to the overworked physicians, who are undersupported by the state. These moments of introspection at the hospital, expressed in black-and-white snapshots, lend a human touch to spaces that are still painfully stigmatised in the public eye.

As consultant dermatologist Dr Anjali Mahto says, long stints sitting in train carriages, ferries, cars or planes “expose skin to stressors, such as aircon or low cabin humidity, which can make it feel tight or dry, due to what’s known as transepidermal water loss.” She adds that “disrupted sleep patterns, dehydration from limited water intake, and poor diet choices” can lead to dullness, puffiness and inflammation. </p> <p>Eyes are particularly affected by long trips, especially if you’re looking at a phone or other screen for long periods, or a contact lens wearer with naturally dry eyes like myself. “Screens cause us to blink less, while dry air and overall dehydration can leave eyes gritty, sore and tired,” says consultant ophthalmic surgeon Ali Mearza. However, a little pampering on the go, plus some smart tech, can help to mitigate the worst effects.</p> <p>This year, I’ve taken train journeys across Italy, an overnight long-haul flight to Sri Lanka, and mini buses through the hairpin roads of the Alps. Along the way I’ve tried and tested plenty of products. These are the travel beauty saviours that have kept me feeling my best, many of which I wouldn’t go on a trip without.<strong> </strong> </p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Beauty hacks for long journeys</strong></h2> <p>***</p> <h2>Keep hydrated</h2>    <p><strong>Larq bottle filtered flip top, 500ml</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.livelarq.com/purification/larq-bottle-filtered-flip-top-granite-white-essential-filter\" > £49.50 at Larq </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/LARQ-Bottle-Flip-Top-25oz/dp/B0C6J3BGC6\" > £39.95 at Amazon </a>  <p>Dehydration can exacerbate skin dryness and dullness after travel, so keep on track by drinking the recommended <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-guidelines-and-food-labels/water-drinks-nutrition/\">six to eight cups of fluid a day</a>. Larq’s sleek smart-tech water bottle has a filtration system that removes heavy metals, chlorine and other particulates to improve the taste of tap water on the go. It comes on a carabiner so you can pop it on a backpack when you need to be hands-free.</p> <p><em><strong>For more, read our guide to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/14/best-water-bottles-tested-uk\">the best water bottles tried and tested</a></strong></em></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Calm your nerves</h2>    <p><strong>Ross J Barr Calm patches</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/product/ross-jbarr-supplements-calm-patches-pack-of-ten_R04072063/\" > £15 for 10 at Selfridges </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://victoriahealth.com/calm-patches/\" > £15 for 10 at Victoria Health </a>  <p>If, like me, travelling makes you feel a little antsy or fatigued, you may find these herb-infused aromatherapy patches help you feel more at ease. I pop them on the temples or wherever I’m seeking relief – they have a soothing effect and can be used for many things, from headaches to tension and even brain fog. Pat them on to skin for a couple of minutes to allow them to work. These include chuanxiong for a calming effect, safflower to reduce inflammation and asarum for aches and pains.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Multitasking skin spray</h2>    <p><strong>Clinisoothe+ skin purifier, 100ml</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.sephora.co.uk/p/clinisoothe-clinisoothe-skin-purifier-100ml\" > £14.95 at Sephora </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clinisoothe-Skin-Purifier-100ml/dp/B08LTTBGPN/\" > £14.20 at Amazon </a>  <p>If you’ve not heard of hypochlorous acid, then it’s time to get familiar. Beauty insiders swear by its effectiveness at calming and cleansing skin. It has a skin-neutral pH, so it’s gentle on sensitive and acne-prone complexions. Clinisoothe is a multitasking skin spray with a high purity of hypochlorous – and for me, it’s a must-have when travelling. Spritz it on your face – keep your eyes closed – or body whenever skin feels tight, irritated, or in need of a cleanse. I also use it on surfaces in my vicinity when on a long-haul journey. Don’t let the word acid scare you: hypochlorous acid is naturally produced by the body as an antimicrobial with healing function.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Hydration for the eyes</h2>    <p><strong>Peep Club instant relief eye spray, 17ml</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://peepclub.co.uk/products/instant-relief-eye-spray\" > £15 at Peep Club </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Peep-Club-Instant-Relief-Spray/dp/B0BN4BK45V\" > £15 at Amazon </a>  <p>If you suffer from dry eyes like me, Peep Club’s gentle spray provides instant relief for dry and itchy eyes. A single spray on closed lids hydrates and comforts not just the<strong> </strong>eyes, but the delicate eyelid and undereye area too. It contains colourless sea buckthorn oil to help soften skin and lock in moisture.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>A nice smell to escape any bad ones</h2>    <p><strong>Diem Quiet Riot eau de parfum</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.diemscents.com/collections/our-fragrances/products/quiet-riot\" > £25 for 10ml plus case at Diem </a>  <p>You can’t control the smells around you, especially on public transport, but you can control your own. I like to pack a mini perfume to transport myself somewhere sweeter-smelling at a moment’s notice. Diem’s reusable twist-to-release case and 10ml minis are ideal for travel, and are eau de parfums, so they’re longer lasting than diluted eau de toilettes. I love Quiet Riot: it has fresh matcha and basil leaf notes, and the magnolia and osmanthus are comforting and calming.</p> <p><em><strong>For more, read our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/mar/21/best-travel-size-toiletries\">best travel minis</a></strong></em></p> <p>***</p> <h2>An app to help with jet lag</h2>    <p><strong>Timeshifter app</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.timeshifter.com/try\" > £9.99 per plan or £21.99 a year at Timeshifter </a>  <p>If you’re changing time zone on your trip, then several things can help minimise the jet lag: light exposure, altering your bedtime and wake-up alarm and controlling caffeine intake. This app has been a saviour for me on long-haul trips as it does all the hard work for you, suggesting new timings for your routine once you input your flight details.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Lightweight glasses for long journeys</h2>    <p><strong>Jimmy Fairly Elvie frames</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.jimmyfairly.com/en-gb/products/p462-h653e-elvie\" > From £135 at Jimmy Fairly </a>  <p>For comfort and hygiene, contact lenses are best swapped for glasses during travel, especially in aeroplane cabins where low humidity can dry out eyes. Larger frames can feel cumbersome when worn for long periods, so I like Jimmy Fairly’s petite, Miu Miu-style Elvie ones as they’re lightweight and comfy. </p> <p>***</p> <h2>Drink greens on the go</h2>    <p><strong>WelleCo the Super Elixir mini</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.welleco.co.uk/products/the-super-elixir-mini-one-serve\" > £2 at WelleCo </a>  <p>High-sodium travel snacks can leave you feeling sluggish, bloated and dehydrated – not helped by sitting still for hours. So, when packing fresh food isn’t an option, I pop a greens powder in my water bottle to add antioxidants and fibre to my fluid intake. Elle Macpherson’s WelleCo Super Elixir comes in sachets that are super-handy for travel, and I enjoy the taste much more than many similar products.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Antioxidant capsules</h2>    <p><strong>Beauty Pie Superactive capsules</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.beautypie.com/products/superactive-capsules-vitamin-c-and-vitamin-e-serum\" > £27 at Beauty Pie </a>  <p>These Beauty Pie capsules are filled with serum for a dose of the antioxidants vitamin E and C, which <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38284201/\">help shield skin from light and pollution damage</a>.

But actually it’s very good and needn’t be confined to travel, especially if you’re prone to very dehydrated skin year-round. The ingredients list is essentially a hydration supergroup: glycerin, squalane, hyaluronic acid, propanediol and ceramides, and the effects can be seen and felt for many hours.

The renowned academic, whose area of research relates to Victorian cemeteries including Highgate, Brompton and Abney Park, is required to be based in London.</p> <p>She has successfully renewed her visa seven times in the past. But in 2022, she became seriously mentally ill. She was hospitalised for 13 weeks and was unable to engage with the visa renewal system as a result of being so unwell.</p> <p>She overstayed for 46 days before her family in Canada could make an application for further leave to remain on her behalf. Since then she has been trying to resolve her visa situation for three years with no success, despite submitting extensive documentary evidence to the Home Office about the medical emergency she experienced.</p> <p>“I am deeply concerned about the effects this will have on my research and employment and on my quality of life and continued recovery,” Scott said. “This feels like a penalty for an infraction that was outside of my control. It does not seem right that I should be punished for having an illness.”</p> <p>Her mental health has improved and she has resumed her academic research.</p> <p>She has lodged an appeal on human rights grounds, but if it is unsuccessful she is facing a ban from the UK. An application she made in 2024 for leave to remain was refused on the grounds that she was medically stable and could return to Canada.</p> <p>Scott said: “My case highlights the issue of the Home Office applying policy in a way that is actually at odds with their own and Prime Minister Starmer’s priority of attracting and retaining highly qualified professionals within the UK’s research and employment sectors. It also highlights the hostility of the current climate regarding mental illness.”</p> <p>In its refusal letter, the Home Office said that indefinite leave to remain was “a privilege, not an automatic entitlement”. Officials added: “A mere wish, desire or preference to live in the UK does not amount to an exceptional circumstance.”</p> <p>They said the fact she was prevented from applying in time to renew her visa due to being “acutely ill” also did not amount to an exceptional circumstance.</p> <p>Scott’s solicitor, Muhunthan Paramesvaran of Wilson Solicitors, said: “This is an exceptional case and the Home Office’s decision is wrong in my view. She has spent 10 years here lawfully and had it not been for her mental health issues she would have been able to sit the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/life-in-the-uk-test\">Life in the UK</a> test and would have been granted indefinite leave to remain.</p> <p>“The Home Office has discretion to grant indefinite leave to remain outside the rules.

From all-star SPFs to hydrating hair care, these are the trusted hot-weather beauty buys to know, all tried and tested by me.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>The best hair products for hot and humid weather</h2> <p>***</p> <p>‘Sun and heat dehydrate hair and break down the bonds that hold it together, which can leave it frizzy and dull or rough in texture,” says hairdresser Hadley Yates. Dyed hair is worst hit by warm weather, he adds, as “UV rays break down colour pigments and oxidise dye molecules, causing fading”. Covering hair as much as possible with a sun hat or scarf – especially the fragile ends – is important, as is the use of heat-protection products, including those that add moisture back into the hair.</p>    <p><strong>Philip Kingsley Swimcap water-resistant mask</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/philip-kingsley-swimcap-water-resistant-mask-100ml/14975526/\" > £24 for 100ml at Cult Beauty </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.lookfantastic.com/p/philip-kingsley-swimcap-water-resistant-mask-100ml/14975526/\" > £25 for 100ml at Look Fantastic </a>  <p>Your hair is like a sponge, so if you’re heading to the beach or lido, make sure you at least saturate your locks with clean water before a swim. If dry, it will absorb the salty or chlorinated water. Even better, apply a mask, such as Philip Kinglsey’s Swimcap, to shield it. It doesn’t feel sticky or heavy when applied and will moisturise locks while protecting them.</p>    <p><strong>Amika Frizz-me-not hydrating anti-frizz treatment</strong></p>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.sephora.co.uk/p/amika-frizz-me-not-hydrating-anti-frizz-treatment-200ml\" > £28 for 200ml at Sephora </a>  <a class=\"element element-link\" href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/amika-frizz-me-not-hydrating-anti-frizz-treatment-200ml/16642637/\" > £28 for 200ml at Cult Beauty </a>  <p>Blow-drying in 30C+ heat?

I like Bouclème’s hydrating formula with coconut fruit extract, castor oil and kukui nut oil; it’s lightweight and leaves no tell-tale crispiness once hair is dry. Apply it to wet lengths and scrunch upwards in sections to encourage natural texture.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>The best skincare for hot weather</h2> <p>***</p> <p>For skin, consultant dermatologist Dr Anjali Mahto says you should “prioritise lightweight hydration and gentle cleansing to remove sweat and sunscreen buildup without stripping the skin”.

Researchers have found the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution released by wildfires is even <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21708-0\">more toxic</a> than air pollution from other sources. One possible reason is the high level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) mixed with various levels of other known <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969724013780#:~:text=Wildfire%20smoke%20is%20composed%20of,)%20and%20arsenic%20(As).\">neurotoxic</a> particles that can be found in smoke, including heavy metals.

Recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/29/wildfire-smoke-dementia-risk\">research</a> from the Universities of Washington and Pennsylvania found that the odds of a new dementia diagnosis increased about 21% for every 1 microgram increase in the concentration of wildfire particles a person inhales, compared with a 3% increased risk for every 3 microgram jump in non-wildfire particles.</p> <p>Additional research from the University of New Mexico suggests that sudden increases in air pollution, as occur during wildfires, create surges of inflammation in the hippocampus region of the brain, responsible for memory and learning. These can linger for over a <a href=\"https://neurosciencenews.com/hippocampuus-wildfire-smoke-inflammation-23846/#:~:text=How%20Wildfire%20Smoke%20Can%20Alter%20Brain%20Health%20and%20Trigger%20Inflammation,-FeaturedNeurologyNeuroscience&amp;text=Summary%3A%20Researchers%20discovered%20that%20wildfire,crucial%20for%20learning%20and%20memory.\">month after exposure</a>.</p> <p>That may explain why, in addition to several studies finding a correlation between smoke exposure and poorer concentration and decision making skills while playing <a href=\"https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP10498\">digital games</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9819793/\">sports</a>, smoky days also appear linked to poorer academic performance.</p> <p>In a 2020 study, UC San Diego economist and researcher Josh Graff Zivin <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304387820301358\">examined</a> how smoky air affected students taking China’s national college entrance exam over a six year period. Graff Zivin specifically studied smoke created by routine, controlled agricultural fires, removing potential anxiety related to possible evacuations as a factor from the study.</p>    <p>His team found that when there was a significant increase in fires upwind compared to downwind during the exam, students’ total scores dropped by 0.6 points on average. This decrease in scores also slightly reduced students’ likelihood of getting into top-tier universities. A US <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~mburke/papers/WenBurke2022_smokelearning.pdf\">study</a> from 2022 estimated that smoke exposure in 2016 reduced students’ future earnings by nearly $1.7bn (or $111 per student).</p> <p>“We don’t exactly know what’s happening to the brain” during heavy smoke days, says Graff Zivin. “But we know it’s bad.”</p> <p>The cardiovascular effects of smoke inhalation may affect our body’s ability to properly oxygenate our brains. “Just having impaired lung function could lead to cognitive impairment,” he says.</p> <p>But more research is required to fully understand the extent to which smoky days affect cognitive performance. Nor do we yet fully understand the cumulative impact of being exposed to smoke for weeks or months each year, Graff Zivin adds.</p> <h2>What’s the relationship between smoky days and depression?</h2> <p>It’s not exactly clear how smoke may physiologically impact the brain in ways that contribute to feelings of depression, but <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2806103\">researchers believe</a> cognitive impairment – like that which Graff Zivin observed among test-taking students – can be a factor in low mood.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, she found that those who faced significant personal loss or trauma during the fires exhibited the highest levels of PTSD, anxiety and depression. Yet even community members who were not directly impacted by the fire reported increased neurocognitive issues, and struggled with depression and anxiety.</p> <h2>Can wildfires cause environment-related anxiety?</h2> <p>Some of the dread people living close to wildfires feel is related to “seeing landscapes change, environments change, and worrying about both the present and the future,” says Dr Warren Dodd, an associate professor in the School of Public Health Sciences at the University of Waterloo.</p> <p>Dodd has <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29981098/\">interviewed</a> residents of Canada’s Northwest Territories who experienced what was, in 2014, a record fire season. They reported feelings of anger, stress and hopelessness about the threats posed by climate change.</p> <p>In addition to the distress of witnessing one’s environment change rapidly – also known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/25/i-see-blossom-in-january-and-feel-a-sickening-swell-of-solastalgia\">solastalgia</a> – the people Dodd interviewed reported that stopping their summertime outdoor and land-based activities to shelter indoors had negative consequences for their mental health.</p> <h2>What can we do about the mental health effects of wildfires?</h2> <p>Curtailing the physiological effects of wildfire smoke on our brains involves many of the same behaviors as protecting the rest of our bodies from air pollution: using an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/article/2024/jul/30/air-purifiers-what-to-know\">air purifier</a> indoors, thoroughly cleaning living spaces to remove <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/feb/06/what-is-dust-cleaning-fire-smoke\">particulate matter that gets inside</a>, wearing a mask outdoors and minimizing unnecessary time spent outside.</p> <p>When it comes to mitigating the psychological harms of smoky days, local authorities can spring into action. Making community resources available for free during wildfires is one way to help people alleviate some of the isolation and anxiety felt when sheltering indoors. For instance, Dodd notes that the city of Yellowknife waived fees for its indoor recreation center during the fire, allowing people to get some exercise and see their neighbors without having to be outside.</p> <p>Resilience is important for communities to focus on, says Mishra – not just after a climate disaster, but also preemptively. “When we studied the Camp fire folks, we found that there are certainly some traits, such as greater mindfulness and better physical activity that can contribute to a sense of resilience,” she says. But the strength of people’s family and social connections were also a significant factor in their resilience. </p> <p>People who “feel supported and like there’s a sense of community around you are best protected in terms of their mental health outcomes”, she says. A stronger sense of community can be an antidote for loneliness and a tool for climate resilience, Mishra notes. For those experiencing PTSD, therapy for underlying neurocognitive issues can assist with recovery.</p> <p>As ever, prevention is key: reducing greenhouse gas emissions can slow global warming and help curb forest fires and their devastating, complex consequences.</p> <p>Graff Zivin believes that governments must bear in mind the economic repercussions of diminished productivity and cognitive function, and invest more heavily in wildfire prevention and forest health. A healthy forest maintained with prescribed burns can lead to <a href=\"https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/washington/stories-in-washington/reduce-wildfires-healthy-forests/\">less intense</a> wildfires, he says. “We rarely talk about the value of having healthy forests.”</p>","source":"The Guardian","author":""},{"id":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/05/verbally-abused-children-more-likely-to-have-poor-mental-health-as-adults-study-finds","title":"Verbally abused children more likely to have poor mental health as adults, study finds","description":"Analysis suggests long-term damage to wellbeing can be worse than for children experiencing physical abuse","imageUrl":"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad577da7e122ef1aad6b0bb0d1d4a4ab6bd24ff4/497_0_2313_1851/500.jpg","category":"Mental Health","date":"2025-08-05","content":"<p>Parents who ridicule, threaten or humiliate their children risk leaving them with a 64% higher chance of having poor mental health as an adult, a study has found.</p> <p>The research also found physical abuse experienced among the research participants reduced over time, while verbal abuse increased.</p> <p><a href=\"http://press.psprings.co.uk/Open/august/bmjopen098412.pdf\">Published in BMJ Open</a>, the study gathered data of 20,687 adults from seven studies published between 2012 and 2024.</p> <p>The studies used all involved questions on childhood physical and verbal abuse using the validated Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) tool and the Warwick-Edinburgh mental wellbeing scale to measure individual and combined components of adult mental wellbeing.</p> <p>Participants were asked over a two-week period about their mental wellbeing, with responses given a score to determine whether the participant had a low or high sense of mental wellbeing.</p> <p>While physical abuse was associated with a 52% increase in the likelihood of a person experiencing low mental wellbeing as an adult, verbal abuse was linked to a slightly higher likelihood at 64%, according to analysis of the results.</p> <p>The analysis also found that, even when physical abuse was part of a person’s childhood experiences, participants who also experienced verbal abuse faced additional risks. The prevalence of low mental wellbeing for those who had experienced no abuse stood at 16%, rising to 22.5% for physical abuse, 24% for verbal abuse, and 29% for both physical and verbal abuse.</p> <p>Furthermore, the prevalence of physical abuse halved from about 20% among those born between 1950 and 1979 to 10% among participants born in or after 2000.

But reports suggested AI was becoming a substitute for people feeling as though they were priced out of therapy or unable to access it, she added.</p> <p>“The issue really is the whole idea of AI is it’s a mirror – it reflects back to you what you put into it,” she said. “That means it’s not going to offer an alternative perspective. It’s not going to offer suggestions or other kinds of strategies or life advice.</p> <p>“What it is going to do is take you further down the rabbit hole, and that becomes incredibly dangerous when the person is already at risk and then seeking support from an AI.”</p> <p>She said even for people not yet at risk, the “echo chamber” of AI can exacerbate whatever emotions, thoughts or beliefs they might be experiencing.</p> <p>O’Doherty said while chatbots could ask questions to check for an at-risk person, they lacked human insight into how someone was responding. “It really takes the humanness out of psychology,” she said.</p> <p>“I could have clients in front of me in absolute denial that they present a risk to themselves or anyone else, but through their facial expression, their behaviour, their tone of voice – all of those non-verbal cues … would be leading my intuition and my training into assessing further.”</p> <p>O’Doherty said teaching people critical thinking skills from a young age was important to separate fact from opinion, and what is real and what is generated by AI to give people “a healthy dose of scepticism”. But she said access to therapy was also important, and difficult in a cost-of-living crisis.</p> <p>She said people needed help to recognise “that they don’t have to turn to an inadequate substitute”.</p> <p>“What they can do is they can use that tool to support and scaffold their progress in therapy, but using it as a substitute has often more risks than rewards.”</p> <h2>Humans ‘not wired to be unaffected’ by constant praise</h2> <p>Dr Raphaël Millière, a lecturer in philosophy at Macquarie University, said human therapists were expensive and AI as a coach could be useful in some instances.</p> <p>“If you have this coach available in your pocket, 24/7, ready whenever you have a mental health challenge [or] you have an intrusive thought, [it can] guide you through the process, coach you through the exercise to apply what you’ve learned,” he said. “That could potentially be useful.”</p> <p>But humans were “not wired to be unaffected” by AI chatbots constantly praising us, Millière said. “We’re not used to interactions with other humans that go like that, unless you [are] perhaps a wealthy billionaire or politician surrounded by sycophants.”</p> <p>Millière said chatbots could also have a longer term impact on how people interact with each other.</p> <p>“I do wonder what that does if you have this sycophantic, compliant [bot] who never disagrees with you, [is] never bored, never tired, always happy to endlessly listen to your problems, always subservient, [and] cannot refuse consent,” he said. “What does that do to the way we interact with other humans, especially for a new generation of people who are going to be socialised with this technology?”</p> <p><em>• In Australia, support is available at <a href=\"https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\">Beyond Blue</a> on 1300 22 4636, <a href=\"https://www.lifeline.org.au/\">Lifeline</a> on 13 11 14, and at <a href=\"https://mensline.org.au/\">MensLine</a> on 1300 789 978.

At the end of 2024, podcaster and self-help guru Mel Robbins published a book called The Let Them Theory. Its central thesis was simple: if someone is doing something that bothers you, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/29/let-them-mel-robbins-self-help-mantra\">let them</a>.</p> <p>The book made a splash. It jumped to the top of bestseller lists. There were news articles and podcast episodes about the theory, and Oprah called it a “gamechanger”. People even got “Let them” tattoos.</p> <p>The theory was not without critics. Some claimed Robbins cribbed the idea from poet Cassie B Phillips, whose poem, Let Them, went viral in 2022. Others said the concept was obvious. But sometimes obvious advice is the most helpful. As one therapist said: “It’s a reminder that it’s OK to step back, let people be who they are, and stop carrying things that aren’t ours to carry.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/29/let-them-mel-robbins-self-help-mantra\"><sub>More about the ‘let them’ theory</sub></a></p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Creatine</strong></h2>    <p>Strength training has been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/09/weightlifting-tips-beginner-strength-training#:~:text=Start%20without%20weights,%2C%20pushups%2C%20lunges%20and%20planks.\">darling</a> of the fitness world recently (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jul/25/older-women-weightlifting\">deservedly</a> so), and as more people spend time moving heavy weights, there is an increasing demand for products and supplements that help maximize each lift.

Online, many speculated that her youthful appearance was the result of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jun/27/what-is-a-deep-plane-facelift\">a deep plane facelift</a> – a technique that works with deeper layers of tissue than a traditional facelift. Searches for the term soared. (Jenner did not discuss or confirm any particular procedures.)</p> <p>A deep plane facelift is pricey, because it is a more complex procedure, and also tends to last a few more years. It can set a patient back anywhere from $30,000 to $100,000. By contrast, the average cost of a regular facelift in the US is about $11,395.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jun/27/what-is-a-deep-plane-facelift\"><sub>More about deep plane facelifts</sub></a></p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Psyllium husk</strong></h2>    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jun/11/what-is-psyllium-husk\">Psyllium husk</a> has been touted by influencers as “nature’s Ozempic” – a cheap, non-prescription alternative to GLP-1 medications. But this comparison is “oversimplified and misleading”, warns Lena Beal, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Psyllium husk comes from the seed of a desert shrub, and is the leading ingredient in popular laxatives like Metamucil. When consumed with water, it’s simply a good source of soluble fiber, and has been found to help lower levels of “bad” cholesterol, slow down digestion and increase satiety.</p> <p>If psyllium husk isn’t your thing (some people don’t enjoy the gloopy, gel-like texture it develops in water) don’t fear. There are plenty of other good sources of fiber, like fruits, vegetables and legumes.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jun/11/what-is-psyllium-husk\"><sub>More about psyllium husk</sub></a></p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Fibermaxxing</strong></h2> <p>As protein mania reaches a fever pitch, consumers are already looking toward the next nutrition trend. According to some on social media, the future is all about “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/09/fibremaxxing-could-tiktoks-latest-wellness-trend-actually-make-sense\">fibermaxxing</a>” – a trendy term for “eating a lot of fiber”. As one wellness influencer put it, fiber is “super cool”. Indeed, one study found a fiber-rich diet can improve heart health and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer. You could give psyllium husk a try – or just eat an apple.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/09/fibremaxxing-could-tiktoks-latest-wellness-trend-actually-make-sense\"><sub>More about fibermaxxing</sub></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"inline button\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>","source":"The Guardian","author":""},{"id":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6n2vwdq8go?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss","title":"Pharmacist suspended after BBC Botox sting","description":"Cornelius Agoye was filmed supplying Botox to an undercover BBC researcher in a breach of the rules.","imageUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/92cf/live/a13ed8c0-be35-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg","category":"Health","date":"2025-11-11","content":"Cornelius Agoye was filmed supplying Botox to an undercover BBC researcher in a breach of the rules.","source":"BBC Health News","author":"BBC Health News"},{"id":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/19/nsw-police-mental-health-waterloo-ntwnfb","title":"‘He begged not to die’: partner of man who died after being restrained by police joins calls to change mental health response","description":"Taite Collins filmed his partner Collin Burling being restrained by officers at their public housing block in Sydney’s Waterloo","imageUrl":"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f7e4bb4c49493e608b8597c5464a13a3f6beca6/693_0_6827_5464/500.jpg","category":"Mental Health","date":"2025-07-18","content":"<p>Taite Collins says he will always wonder if he could have done something more to stop what unfolded just metres below his home in one of Sydney’s largest public housing estates.

A rally planned for the second anniversary of Deacon’s death on Saturday will now also honour Burling.</p> \n<p>Judy Deacon has been meeting with ministers and senior officials to push for triple zero calls to triage to a mental health service staffed by skilled responders.</p> \n<p>“They tell me when I have these meetings that it’s all happening,” she says about the general push for change.</p> \n<p>“But I still don’t know what it is that is happening and, as far as I’m concerned, until it happens, nothing is happening.”</p> \n<p>Rose Jackson, the mental health and housing minister, recognises that the current mental health crisis response system is not working. She tells Guardian Australia work on a new model is well under way and remains a priority.</p> \n<p>Geoff Turnbull, the spokesperson for community group REDWatch – which advocates for people living in public housing in Redfern and Waterloo – says Burling’s death is symptomatic of a systemic problem that goes beyond the way police respond to mental health incidents.</p> \n<p>He says the ailing mental health system is also an issue. Mental health professionals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/01/bondi-junction-inquest-joel-cauchi-police-mental-health-failures\">have raised concerns in the past</a> that services are faltering, which leads to the buck being passed to police.</p> \n<p>While this is a statewide issue, he says special attention needs to be given to those living in public housing and is calling for more wraparound services.</p> \n<p>“It’s where people with mental health and drug and alcohol and trauma and other related things are actually concentrated,” Turnbull says.</p> \n<p>“These are the issues that people have to substantiate to get public housing in the first place. But then there is little follow[-up] to help with the issues that got them the tenancy in the first place.”</p> \n<h2>‘It was love at first sight’</h2> \n<p>Collins agrees there should be more support. He has been on a five-month waiting list to access a mental health service.</p> \n<p>He says he and Burling moved into the Waterloo public housing estate after experiencing homelessness. It was the first stable home that Burling – who moved in more than five years ago – had since he was 12.</p> \n<p>The couple met in the foyer one afternoon about four years ago.</p> \n<p>“It was love at first sight,” Collins says. “He was the sort of person who loved to give everything a go. He loved the world of skateboarding and surfing.</p> \n<p>“He’s a big burly bloke, but he’s a big squishy teddy bear.”</p> \n<p>Collins says some days Burling’s mental health was bad.</p> \n<p>“It wasn’t worsening. It wasn’t improving. He had a lot of undiagnosed mental health and unmedicated mental health [issues], which he had booked in appointments through his psychiatrist to finally get that assessments done.”</p> \n<p>The night Burling died was like any other, Collins says. They had been hanging out with friends in Burling’s apartment before Collins went downstairs to have a shower.</p> \n<p>He says he left because he had a headache and was feeling dizzy. They had both been concerned that there was a carbon monoxide leak in the building and Burling said he would ring the fire brigade. Collins is not sure why the ambulance and then the police turned up.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/15/two-police-officeers-punched-and-kicked-schizophrenic-woman-out-of-frustration-ntwnfb\">Two NSW police officers punched and kicked woman with schizophrenia ‘out of frustration’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Collin had done nothing wrong.

Unlike bubonic plague, which killed millions in medieval Europe, it can be spread through airborne droplets.</p> \n<p>While both are caused by the <em>Yersinia pestis</em> bacterium, bubonic plague is transmitted through rodent flea bites or contact with contaminated material – and it primarily affects the lymph nodes while pneumonic plague causes pneumonia and respiratory symptoms.</p> \n<p>Authorities said the person, whose age, name and gender have not been released, had entered the Flagstaff Medical Center emergency department and died on the same day.</p> \n<p>Hospital operator Northern Arizona Healthcare<a href=\"https://www.coconino.az.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=3242\"> said in a statement </a>that “despite appropriate initial management and attempts to provide life-saving resuscitation, the patient did not recover”.</p> \n<p>The death of the Coconino county resident marks the first recorded pneumonic plague death in the county in 18 years but not the most recent human plague case in Arizona – the state has recorded seven cases of plague since 2006.</p> \n<p>The 2007 death reportedly occurred after the person involved had contact with a dead animal infected with plague.</p> \n<p>Nationally, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says about seven human cases of plague are reported annually across the country, but only<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html\"> 15 plague deaths</a> have been recorded in a 23-year period beginning in 2000. Most cases have been seen in rural areas in the west.</p> \n<p>Typically, the CDC says, <em>Yersinia pestis</em> cycles naturally among wild rodents. And while most people contract the disease though flea bites, they can become infected through exposure to sick pets, especially cats.</p> \n<p>The plague death comes as officials in the county are investigating a sudden die-off of prairie dogs north-east of Flagstaff that may be caused by plague. County officials have said they do not think the human plague death and the prairie dog mortalities are related.</p> \n<p>But they also issued guidelines about how to avoid contracting the plague, including avoiding contact with wild animals, touching sick or dead animals, camping near rodent burrows, or sleeping directly on the ground. They advise using insect repellent and tucking the cuffs of your trouser leg into your socks.</p> \n<p>Coconino county health officials said the risk of human-to-human transmission of pneumonic plague is low. The last such transmission was in Los Angeles in 1924, <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2595158/\">according to National Institutes of Health (NIH) data.</a></p> \n<p>Still, the symptoms of the Black Death – named for black spots that appeared on infected bodies – remain present. US health officials say plague symptoms typically appear within eight days after exposure and may include fever, chills, headache, weakness and muscle pain, and some may develop swollen lymph nodes (called “buboes”), most commonly in the groin, armpits or limbs.</p> \n<p>But the timing of the human plague death, and the prairie dog die-off, is raising concerns.

An unwillingness to examine the challenging social and economic conditions – from housing insecurity to financial concerns – means there can be a tendency to explain this rise as a result of overdiagnosis, although there is little evidence for this claim. Clinicians cite the criteria for diagnosis to show that overreporting is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/05/does-the-uk-have-a-mental-health-overdiagnosis-problem-welfare-wes-streeting\">not substantiated</a> – if anything, the severity of reported conditions has increased, in part due to a reduced stigma resulting in more people seeking help.</p> <p>Young people with poor mental health are <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-report-reveals-young-people-nearly-fives-time-more-likely-to-be-put-out-of-work\">nearly five times</a> more likely to be out of work, and there is a growing understanding that inadequate support around young people’s mental health in the workplace is driving them to <a href=\"https://www.employment-studies.co.uk/system/files/resources/files/Young_Peoples_Mental_Health_Report_final.pdf\">leave or consider leaving their job</a>. In response, the government has proposed cuts to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg8pz1g8q9o\">under-22s’ health support</a>.</p> <p>While there isn’t evidence that removing financial support motivates people back to work, there are things we can change to make workplaces healthier environments – and, for the times when things are not OK, for poor mental health to be accommodated and supported.</p> <p>Too often workplaces default to fear, competition, “everyone out for themselves” attitudes and poor trust between colleagues. In this context it’s dangerous to admit to struggling with your mental health, and there is still a tendency to see these struggles as a diversion from the norm rather than as a normal part of the human experience. Our mental health is also hugely affected by the social, economic and political conditions in modern society.</p> <p>A lot can happen during our working life. Maybe a parent gets sick, we have caring responsibilities, we suffer an unexpected loss or financial difficulties: these can all trigger difficulties in our mental health. Alongside life events, persistent structural <a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/tips-for-everyday-living/racism-and-mental-health/\">racism</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thementalhealthcoalition.org/social-class-and-mental-health/\">classism</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youngminds.org.uk/young-person/blog/everyday-ableism-the-impact-on-mental-health/\">ableism</a> take their toll. Having a workplace that recognises these factors – normalising all mental health struggles whether there is an immediate reason or not – can be important to being able to stay in work. A both rewarding and sad moment for me in my last few months of being a director at an NGO was a relatively new employee saying: “I know I can get sick here and it would be OK.” He had previously worked at another organisation where, when sick leave was taken, it would implicitly be viewed as an inconvenience to the rest of the team.</p> <p>There is no shortage of people unhappy with their boss – in fact <a href=\"https://mentalhealth-uk.org/blog/burnout-report-2025-reveals-generational-divide-in-levels-of-stress-and-work-absence/\">stress at work is the norm</a>, and people who have a positive relationship with their workplace are in the minority. The UK has the highest percentage of workers globally who say they <a href=\"https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/article/1813965/stressful-conditions-behind-uk-workers-opting-not-work-money-no-object-survey-finds\">wouldn’t work at all</a> if money were no object, with stressful working conditions cited as the main reason. There aren’t just bad apples – something is wrong with the way we organise our places of work. Since society individualises behaviour and managers’ or bosses’ flaws, there is no collective diagnosis for what’s going wrong or how to improve workplace culture and leadership, and raise the bar to a healthier level for what’s OK.</p> <p>Young people are the first cohort to push back against this. They are <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/worklife/article/20220613-gen-z-the-workers-who-want-it-all\">demanding more</a> from their workplace. This is part of a generational shift that is well under way: my four-year-old is taught emotional literacy at nursery and at home, taught to understand his full range of emotions and not to feel shame around them, while his grandparents’ generation is still stuck in the mindset that negative emotions such as sadness or anger are problematic and to be avoided and suppressed rather than understood. Against this backdrop, we should be seeing young people’s struggles with mental health as an invitation to understand not only their situation and context, but also our own.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/25/people-in-20s-more-likely-out-of-work-because-of-ill-health-than-those-in-early-40s\">People in 20s more likely to be out of work because of poor mental health than those in early 40s</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To really undo the ableist concepts around mental health we absorb every day in society, often we need to have our own experience or to deeply empathise with someone close to us. For me, it was my own journey with depression while leading an NGO that forced me to rethink some of my beliefs. First it took me a long time to acknowledge and admit I was depressed. My internal view of myself didn’t allow it to register until a colleague and a friend, both of whom I admired, shared their experiences of depression with me. As I learned to manage my own struggle, I became kinder towards myself and shifted how I led. I was less controlling and more able to let go of things more easily. It became clear to me that it’s not only possible but preferable for high-performing teams to have a culture of care. Showing understanding for others’ situations is an important foundation for then being able to ask people to take responsibility for their own needs and the needs of their role.</p> <p>While I was director we implemented policies and best practices we learned from other organisations, such as the use of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jul/09/sickie-guilty-pleasure-sometimes-just-need-a-duvet-day\">duvet day</a>, when you could take time off without warning if you felt you needed a day in bed – a way of normalising taking days off for poor mental health. Getting the balance right isn’t always straightforward, and there is an ongoing need for self-reflection and accountability.</p> <p>Part of what young people need in order to navigate their difficulties are emotionally mature adults who have their back and who want to understand root causes. What they often get are impatient older generations who think they are complaining too much.

The study found that the opposite is true for older people living in the same communities, who were a third less likely to have undiagnosed mental health problems than people the same age living inland in similar areas of deprivation.</p> \n<p>The Essex researchers, led by Claire Wicks, studied data <a href=\"https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/about/about-the-study/\">from 28,000 adults across the UK</a> to see how different generations experience life in Britain. They looked at the responses from adults living in coastal communities and inland in England between 2018 and 2023 who scored highly against a widely accepted measure of mental distress but where they had not had a diagnosis. Deprivation was determined using the official indices from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.</p> \n<p>Four years ago, a report by England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, found that diagnosed mental health problems <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jul/21/english-coastal-towns-have-some-of-countrys-worst-health-report-says\">were disproportionately higher among young people in coastal </a>areas.</p> \n<p>Separate work by the University of Essex and University College London (UCL), also seen by the Guardian, <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.26.25330335v1\">found a range of factors at play</a>. These included higher levels of poverty but also lower rates of progression to higher education and higher crime levels in the places they live.</p> \n<p>The primary explanation for the disproportionate levels of mental health is the economic and social challenges that people face who live in these communities, said Murray. Household incomes and private renting are key factors.</p> \n<p>“Young people on the coast are more likely to be living in areas where incomes are lower and more families are renting from private landlords,” she said. “On top of that they often live in areas that are geographically isolated, making it harder to reach places where there are more economic and healthcare opportunities.”</p> \n<p>Ceilidh Bardsley, 21, who lives in Weston-super-Mare, described living in a town where it feels as if tourists are given priority. “A lot of emphasis is put into the main seafront for things to look nice” she said. “But then you look around the estates, and there are potholes everywhere, shop fronts are falling down and there’s mould in many of the houses.”</p> \n<p>Twenty-year-old Levi, who has lived in Southend all his life, said that it was an “amazing” place. “But growing up, seeing how many places have closed down, it feels like Southend is getting worse, not better. I couldn’t imagine wanting to bring up children here.”</p> \n<p>Separately, <a href=\"https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10210706/\">the UCL researchers went round the country</a> talking to dozens of policymakers and local practitioners about what could drive change in coastal areas. Many said that what was needed was to champion young people’s voices and<strong> </strong>focus on what local people need and want.</p> \n<p>“I think letting people make decisions is massive, is so important in our town,” said one practitioner in Barrow, in the north-west. “Don’t bring consultants in to tell our communities what they need. Come and talk to us.”</p> \n<p>Others talked about the need for long-term, sustainable public-sector funding to run youth services and community projects, and to train and retain staff, as well as for money to be targeted specifically towards young people in coastal places.</p> \n<p>Prof Sheena Asthana, co-director of the Centre for Coastal Communities at the University of Plymouth, said: “The Essex research confirms our own analysis that signals of poor mental health among young people, such as hospital admissions for self-harm, are disproportionately higher on the coast.</p> \n<p>“The very high rates of undiagnosed mental health in deprived coastal areas suggest that the government might want to explore whether long waiting times for children and young people’s mental health services are to blame.”</p> \n<p>• The Against the Tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and documentary photographer <a href=\"https://www.pollybraden.com/\">Polly Braden</a></p>","source":"The Guardian","author":""},{"id":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/26/young-people-england-common-mental-health-conditions-nhs-survey","title":"One in four young people in England have mental health condition, NHS survey finds","description":"Rates are higher in young women as in young men and mental ill health up across age groups, study shows","imageUrl":"https://media.guim.co.uk/b07c02ffee2a27b9ebbd66159849d21156682987/763_0_4320_3456/500.jpg","category":"Mental Health","date":"2025-06-26","content":"<p>Sharp rises in rates of anxiety, depression and other disorders have led to one in four young people in England having a common mental health condition, an NHS survey shows, with young women more likely to report them than young men.</p> <p>The study found that rates of such conditions in 16- to 24-year-olds have risen by more than a third in a decade, from 18.9% in 2014 to 25.8% in 2024.</p> <p>Results from the <a href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/adult-psychiatric-morbidity-survey/survey-of-mental-health-and-wellbeing-england-2023-24\">adult psychiatric morbidity survey</a> showed that reports of common mental health conditions – a term that also includes panic disorder, phobias and obsessive compulsive disorder – occurred in 36.1% of women compared with 16.3% of men. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/EAOzT/2/\" data-alt=\"Graph showing share of young women reporting mental health\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/EAOzT/2/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Sally McManus, one of the lead researchers on the survey, said the figures reflect many global trends disproportionately affecting young people.</p> <p>“Young people are growing up worried about many aspects of their lives, from insecure employment and housing through to Covid and climate change.

It’s just that we do see, by far and away, the highest rates [of self-harm and suicidal ideation] in young women.”</p> <p>There was no evidence of over-reporting of mental health conditions, she added. “I don’t see this as reflecting over-identification or over-reporting, although there is greater awareness and less stigma.

And overall, more than half of people with common mental health conditions are not getting the help they need, experts said.</p> <p>Marjorie Wallace, the chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said: “This report exposes the huge scale of need facing a system that is already in breakdown, particularly involving the services available to young people.”</p> <p>It comes as the health secretary, Wes Streeting, is set to announce that mental health patients will be able to self-refer for talking therapies using the NHS app. He said the government was “putting digital front doors on mental health services for patients up and down the country”.

Participants completed a questionnaire that asked for personal, social, demographic, health and lifestyle information.</p> <p>Health information included lifetime diagnoses for disorders including autoimmune and psychiatric conditions. Six autoimmune conditions were included in the study: rheumatoid arthritis, Graves’ disease (thyroid hormone disorder), inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis.</p> <p>The mental health conditions the researchers were interested in were self-reported diagnoses of affective disorders, defined as depression, bipolar or anxiety disorder.</p> <p>In total, 37,808 people reported autoimmune conditions and 1,525,347 did not. The lifetime prevalence of any diagnosed affective disorder was significantly higher among those with an autoimmune disorder than it was among the general population: 29% against 18%.</p> <p>Similar associations emerged for depression and anxiety: 25.5% compared with just over 15% for depression, and just over 21% compared with 12.5% for anxiety. The prevalence of current depression and anxiety was also higher among people with autoimmune conditions.</p> <p>While the prevalence of bipolar disorder was much lower, it was still significantly higher among those with autoimmune disorders than among the general population: just under 1% compared with 0.5%.</p> <p>The prevalence of affective disorders was also significantly and consistently higher among women with autoimmune disorders than it was among men with the same physical health conditions: 32% compared with 21%.</p> <p>The reasons for this are unclear. But the researchers, whose findings were published in the <a href=\"https://mentalhealth.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmjment-2025-301706\">BMJ Mental Health</a> journal, said theories suggest that sex hormones, chromosomal factors, and differences in circulating antibodies may partly explain the differences.</p> <p>Overall, the risk for mental health conditions was nearly double in people with autoimmune conditions – between 87% and 97% higher. It remained high even after adjusting for potentially influential factors, including age, household income and parental psychiatric history.</p> <p>The study was limited by a lack of available information on the time or duration of illness, making it impossible to determine whether autoimmune conditions preceded, co-occurred with or followed affective disorders.</p> <p>No direct measurements of inflammation were made either, making it impossible to establish the presence, nature, timing or severity of inflammation.</p> <p>The researchers concluded: “Although the observational design of this study does not allow for direct inference of causal mechanisms, this analysis of a large national dataset suggests that chronic exposure to systemic inflammation may be linked to a greater risk for affective disorder.</p> <p>“Future studies should seek to determine whether putative biological, psychological, and social factors – for example, chronic pain, fatigue, sleep or circadian disruptions and social isolation – may represent potentially modifiable mechanisms linking autoimmune conditions and affective disorders.”</p> <p>They added that it could be worth regularly screening people diagnosed with autoimmune diseases for mental health conditions, especially women, to provide them with tailored support early on.</p>","source":"The Guardian","author":""},{"id":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3xgwyywe4o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss","title":"'A predator in your home': Mothers say chatbots encouraged their sons to kill themselves","description":"In her first UK interview Megan Garcia speaks to Laura Kuenssberg about the death of her teenage son.","imageUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/84b4/live/ec7aad20-bbdb-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg","category":"Health","date":"2025-11-08","content":"In her first UK interview Megan Garcia speaks to Laura Kuenssberg about the death of her teenage son.","source":"BBC Health News","author":"BBC Health News"},{"id":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/22/western-bulldogs-jamarra-ugle-hagan-opens-up-on-mental-health-struggles","title":"Bulldogs forward Jamarra Ugle-Hagan opens up on mental health struggles and hitting ‘rock bottom’","description":"AFL star says there were times he ‘didn’t want to leave the house’","imageUrl":"https://media.guim.co.uk/632bb2b0ade8142aa763a57f0853237621b045db/323_0_3226_2581/500.jpg","category":"Mental Health","date":"2025-06-22","content":"<p><br>The Western Bulldogs forward Jamarra Ugle-Hagan has opened up about his mental health struggles for the first time since taking a leave of absence, saying there were times he “didn’t want to leave the house”.</p> <p>The former No 1 draft pick is hoping to make his AFL comeback after recently visiting a health retreat in northern New South Wales.</p> <p>Ugle-Hagan has not played this season but rejoined Bulldogs teammates earlier this week for the first time since April.</p> <p>He revealed the extent of his struggles while speaking with former AFL players Mitch Robinson and Rhys Mathieson on their Rip Through It podcast, saying he had battled with suicidal thoughts.</p> <p>“All the noises actually sent me to a rehab facility for my mental health,” Ugle-Hagan said.</p> <p>“It got to a point where I had to give my car to a mate, so I couldn’t drive – I just didn’t trust myself driving.</p> <p>“There were times when I would think about, to be honest with you, [it is] just not even worth living.</p> <p>“I went through a struggle where I didn’t want to leave the house.

The rate of severe depression is double pre-fire levels, while anxiety is up tenfold compared to earlier benchmarks, according to the study, titled <a href=\"https://uhero.hawaii.edu/from-crisis-to-recovery-health-and-resilience-two-years-after-the-maui-wildfires/\">From Crisis to Recovery: Health and Resilience Two Years After the Maui Wildfires</a>.</p> <p>MauiWES is one of largest post-disaster exposure studies of its kind, and an effort to understand and address the impacts on health and social conditions caused by the deadliest American wildfire in more than a century. At least 102 people died and more than 2,200 homes were destroyed on 8 August 2023 after 50mph winds supercharged a fire that ripped through the historic town of Lahaina in west Maui, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/08/maui-wildfire-six-months-later-housing\">leaving thousands without shelter</a>, work, or access to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/08/maui-wildfire-survivors-health-depression-respiratory-kidney\">adequate health</a> and other basic services.</p> <p>Two years on, more than 40% of adults still lack stable housing and 25% of those looking for work remain unemployed. The number of households unable to afford enough nutritious food – also known as food insecurity – is on the rise, with almost one in four adults regularly skipping meals or going entire days without food due to financial hardship – double the pre-fire rate.</p> <p>Despite some signs of progress and healing, four times as many adults still experience suicidal thoughts compared to before the fire – pointing to deep psychological scars and a need for sustained, culturally appropriate long-term mental health care, according to the report. Failing to address the ongoing psychological trauma – and the housing, economic and food crises caused by the fire – could lead to a future surge in strokes, chronic respiratory disease and other cardiovascular problems.</p> <p>Worryingly, heart and lung issues linked to fire and ash exposure have already become more pronounced.</p> <p>More than 70% of 1,800 survivors in the study now have hypertension – or high blood pressure, while one in four have reduced lung function. The findings come as authorities prepare to move piles of contaminated debris from near Lahaina to central Maui, raising concern among residents about further exposure to environmental toxins.</p> <p>Despite successful efforts to expand coverage, one in six participants remains uninsured, rising to 45% among Latino residents. Nearly a third report persistent issues accessing care or medications – mostly as a result of the fire, the report found.</p> <p>The second tranche of UH findings come after a separate study<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/29/sexual-violence-lahaina-hawaii-wildfires\"> published exclusively by the Guardian </a>last month showed that sexual exploitation of women and domestic violence soared after the Lahaina <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hawaii-fires\">wildfire</a> in 2023. This work is part of a growing effort to better understand and intervene in the health and social consequences of climate-fueled disasters that are wreaking short and long term havoc across the US and globally.</p> <p>In general, women and children are disproportionately impacted by disasters. With almost 200 10- to 17-year-olds now enrolled in the Maui health study, the findings provide the first comprehensive snapshot of child survivors that suggests a hidden mental health crisis which requires urgent attention.</p> <p>Around 45% of the children are experiencing PTSD symptoms, with one in 10 severely impacted by the trauma they have experienced. Half meet the clinical threshold for depression, while 30% struggle with anxiety symptoms such as palpitations, nausea and difficulty breathing. Girls and children identifying as Asian, Filipino and Latino consistently carry the heaviest emotional burden, pointing to the need for culturally grounded, gender-sensitive mental health care in schools and other community jobs.</p> <p>Yet amidst these pressures, Maui’s community bonds remain strong, according to the report, with 90% of participants reporting moderate or high levels of social support. This strong support – anchored in <em>ohana</em> (family), culture and community networks – can serve as a buffer against the long-term health consequences of disaster, but is not enough.</p> <p>Investments in long-term care access, chronic disease screening and respiratory follow-up are critical to avoid deepening health disparities and to promote sustained recovery for Maui’s fire-affected communities, researchers found.</p> <p>“The people of Lahaina have shown extraordinary strength in the face of unimaginable loss. The progress we’re seeing is real – and it’s a testament to the resilience of this community, but the recovery is far from over,” said Ruben Juarez, co-author and professor of economics at the UH Economic Research Organization.</p>","source":"The Guardian","author":""},{"id":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x19k50dlpo?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss","title":"You can now book online to see your GP.

This contains the health records of more than 800,000 people who have lived in Bradford, West Yorkshire, since 1970 that can be studied in an anonymised way. Specifically, the researchers looked at 14,800 people who relocated within the city during early 2021.</p> <p>With increasing <a href=\"https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2023-07-06-poor-air-quality-found-affect-mental-health-many-ways\">evidence that air pollution</a> affects <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bjpsych-open/article/air-quality-and-mental-health-evidence-challenges-and-future-directions/FF3A143292CD1783BA7DC7B744573C5C\">mental health</a>, the researchers focused on prescriptions for drugs for common mental health problems including depression and anxiety. Before moving, 2,100 people were taking these drugs. The researchers then checked for prescriptions a year later.</p> <p>People without a prescription at the start of the study who relocated to an area with more particle air pollution had an 11% greater risk of developing a new mental health problem, compared with the other movers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://borninbradford.nhs.uk/about/our-team/dr-mikel-subiza-perez/\">Dr Mikel Subiza-Pérez</a>, the lead author of the study, said: “We took account of the socioeconomic characteristics of each area, including income deprivation, employment deprivation, education, health deprivation, disability and crime.”</p> <p>Moving to an area with increased green space, as measured by satellite photographs, led to reductions in prescriptions for mental health drugs, but this depended on the quality of the local green space.</p> <p>Subiza-Pérez said: “It appears that living close to poor quality green spaces can worsen mental health. That makes sense if there is nothing for you in that space, or if you do not feel welcome or safe there because of current design and equipment. Many green spaces are not sufficiently equipped for people to use them comfortably, we need benches, shades and other stuff for people of all ages.”</p> <p>The study also revealed some of the difficulties faced by people with mental health problems. McEachan explained: “Our study clearly shows that people experiencing mental health problems tend to move more often and to areas with worse environmental quality, which, in turn, may impact their ability to recover.”</p> <p>The effects of moving to an area with worse air pollution are not confined to mental health. <a href=\"https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1164/ajrccm.164.11.2102005\">A 10-year study in southern California</a> also showed that lung growth improved for children that moved to areas with less particle pollution. The opposite occurred in those who moved to more polluted places. <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/environepidem/fulltext/2019/08000/change_in_pm2_5_exposure_and_mortality_among.2.aspx\">A study of more than 10 million older people</a> in the US showed that relocating to an area with different air pollution affected how long they lived.</p> <p>McEachan summarised the main message from the Bradford study: “If we want to make our cities healthier and happier places to live for all communities then we need to target investment in areas with greatest need. Policy makers should be considering initiatives to reduce pollution and improve the quality public realm space in inner-city areas via investment in regeneration, public transport and traffic reduction.”</p>","source":"The Guardian","author":""},{"id":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/09/robbie-williams-britpop-tour-comeback-has-it-all","title":"Masculinity, mental health, cat food – Robbie Williams’s comeback has it all | Lauren O'Neill","description":"He’s still perfectly capable of putting his foot in his mouth, but the more he reveals of himself the more we seem to love him, says culture writer Lauren O’Neill","imageUrl":"https://media.guim.co.uk/579d5ed256b99d0577713445a062bf79e5698d50/0_0_4047_3238/500.jpg","category":"Nutrition","date":"2025-06-09","content":"<p>Few facts feel more perfect than this: Robbie Williams’s current stadium and arena tour is sponsored by a cat food. Yes, the Britpop tour, promoting Williams’s upcoming album of the same title, is brought to us by Felix (he joins the brand’s feline mascot in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TehgT_TCQO4\">a new campaign</a>). The show has just spent two nights in residence at London’s Emirates Stadium, having previously stopped off in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/01/robbie-williams-review-dazzling-superstar-glow-from-the-king-of-entertainment\">Edinburgh</a>. It will also see dates in Manchester, Bath, Newcastle and Dublin, as well as other cities in Europe, many of which are sold out.</p> <p>I mention the cat food thing because it feels pretty intrinsic to Williams’s popular persona, and how he’s perceived right now. It is, by anyone’s standards, entirely camp in that particularly British, “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jul/07/hun-culture-british-tv-denise-welch-alison-hammond-matriarchs-kim-woodburn\">hun culture</a>” type of way, where glamour goes hand in hand with ordinariness – and that’s exactly where Robbie’s appeal lies in 2025, as he experiences what appears to be a cultural comeback.</p> <p>Indeed, over the past year or so, and particularly over the past six months, Williams has experienced a resurgence, something he himself acknowledges: “Robbie Williams,” he laughed on stage on Friday night. “Back in stadiums, eh?”</p> <p>That’s not the only bit of evidence, however. He’s <a href=\"https://www.glastofestfeed.com/news/rumours/glastonbury-2025-secret-sets-patchwork/\">rumoured</a> to be playing a secret slot at this year’s Glastonbury; he was recently honoured with the PRS for Music Icon award at the Ivors; and while his biopic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/28/better-man-review-robbie-williams-monkeys-around-in-a-raw-and-emotional-biopic\">Better Man</a> was commercially unsuccessful, it went down pretty well with critics, who praised it for its candour about class and addiction. Williams shows up on cosy TV shows such as Michael McIntyre’s The Wheel, not to mention the cat food adverts, but he’s also found an audience with generation Z, as the subject of social media posts featuring archive photos of 90s and 00s fashion and celebrity culture. His appeal in 2025 has become widespread; his music still endures (play Angels in any pub in Britain and it’ll have the same effect as telling everyone there’s a free bar). You could, then, call it a bit of a Robnaissance.</p> <p>This is all happening because Williams occupies a unique position. He’s a charisma machine who regularly plays in front of thousands, but he’ll also happily divulge to his crowds that he’s – and I quote – “knackered” after playing certain songs, and exchanges concerns about erectile dysfunction with a lip-fillered, AI version of his future self in a between-songs bit. If someone from a younger, more self-serious generation – Sam Fender, Harry Styles – were being sponsored by Pedigree Chum it would probably raise a few eyebrows, but for Williams, stuff like the Felix partnership is entirely on brand. The first person, after all, to nudge and wink at Robbie is Robbie.</p> <p>There is a whole section in his show about how he no longer cares for being cool, while dressed in a hot pink suit. On stage, he delightedly acknowledges that his audience is primarily made up of middle-aged mums – “and I love it!” He speaks candidly about his poor mental health <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/share/BAK6rvgPXX\">on Instagram</a>. Interestingly and marvellously, it’s in this total abandon that his star is rising again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/01/robbie-williams-review-dazzling-superstar-glow-from-the-king-of-entertainment\">Robbie Williams review – dazzling superstar glow from the ‘King of Entertainment’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And this could, it should be acknowledged, very easily not have happened. For a while, he wasn’t well received by the public – a video of him singing as his wife Ayda Field gave birth to their child went down online like a ton of bricks, as did a gag where he used hand sanitiser after touching hands with a New Year’s Eve audience on TV. It was only in 2022 that he was widely criticised for performing in Qatar at the football World Cup, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/18/robbie-williams-defends-decision-to-perform-in-qatar-during-world-cup\">responding to the feedback</a> thus: “If we’re not condoning human rights abuses anywhere, then it would be the shortest tour the world has ever known: I wouldn’t even be able to perform in my own kitchen.”</p> <p>Since then, however, the tide has turned. Williams has publicly shown his softer side again. A 2023 <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81638710\">Netflix documentary</a> about his life saw him reviewing photos and footage on his laptop, in bed in his underwear. There’s also the aforementioned mental health chat online, and, of course, Better Man was further insight into his struggles at the hands of the press and the music industry. Broadly, the vulnerability that he has always embraced in his music (“I don’t wanna die, but I ain’t keen on living either”) has become more and more in vogue for men and male celebrities, in response to the frightening versions of masculinity spawning online. It seems that the mainstream masculinity of the day has caught up with the man who openly sang in 2002: “If you don’t need me, I don’t exist.”</p> <p>Williams will probably always have the ability to put his foot in his mouth spectacularly. But the more he reveals of himself, the more he cements his place as a unique and – let’s face it – unparalleled British performer. There is nobody who does what he does, nobody with his legacy or catalogue, nobody who straddles cool and uncool in quite the same way that Brits love so much.</p> <p>From where I am standing, then, Williams’s popularity in the current moment is deserved and hard won, for a performer who has the type of gift you cannot teach. When he emerged on stage in front of 60,000 people on Friday night, he introduced himself simply: “I’m Robbie Williams. This is my band, this is my arse.” He also told us: “I want to be the king of entertainment.” And at this point, you do have to ask: who else could it be? This is his Robnaissance – we’re just living in it.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lauren O’Neill is a culture writer</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

However this is a misunderstanding, since people experience extended mood changes over periods of weeks rather than rapid “mood swings”.</p> <p>“This is an example of misappropriating a mental health diagnosis to wrongly explain or justify behaviour,” said Dan Poulter, a former health minister and NHS psychiatrist. “A person with bipolar disorder may find this trivialising of their experience of living with a debilitating and serious mental illness.”</p> <p>Another popular video suggests that when someone is about to die by suicide they become “almost bipolar” – “language [that] can further stigmatise mental health”, said Prof Rina Dutta, a consultant psychiatrist and psychiatry professor at King’s College London.</p> <p>Another video claims signs of abuse are constantly apologising; breaking down during small disagreements; needing reassurance; struggling to be open; being hypersensitive to criticism, and hiding feelings.</p> <p>“The behaviours it describes, while potentially present in abusive dynamics, are not exclusive to abuse and may occur in a variety of other contexts,” said Modlin. “By presenting these signs without sufficient context or diagnostic nuance, the video risks encouraging viewers to self-diagnose or mislabel complex relational struggles as abuse.”</p> <h2>Unevidenced treatments and false claims</h2>  <p>This was the most common form of misinformation contained in the videos.</p> <p>One video promotes a method it said was cheaper than therapy and had fewer side effects than antidepressants that could enable people “to heal from trauma in an hour” and involved writing about the traumatic experiences for 15 minutes non-stop.</p> <p>“No research suggests this is sufficient for cure, definitely not in an hour, and there is risk of independently forcing oneself back into this traumatic mindset without the support of an experienced therapist,” said Amber Johnston, an accredited psychotherapist.</p> <p>Another clip suggests that crying is self-soothing and good for processing emotions, including by stimulating the release of cortisol. “Cortisol changes related to crying are complex and cannot be distilled down in this way,” said Amy Durden, a psychotherapist. “Crying can bring relief but not always. It can be self-soothing but if the person crying judges their crying negatively, they do not experience this benefit and may feel acute shame.”</p> <p>Several videos featured glib quotations that the experts viewed as unhelpful such as: “If you’re not changing, you’re choosing”, while another popular quotation said: “When you feel like everyone hates you, sleep. When you feel like you hate everyone, eat. When you feel like you hate yourself, shower. And when you feel like everyone hates everyone, go outside.”</p> <p>“This is a huge oversimplification of how to address complex emotional states,” said Durden. “It seems to be pulling from behavioural activation in CBT, but without any context or individualisation.”</p> <p>A specific breathing technique for treating anxiety was promoted in another video. “There is no single, universally effective breathing technique that is helpful in all cases,” said David Okai, a consultant neuropsychiatrist. “If performed incorrectly, the exercises can be the equivalent of hyperventilation, which can be extremely unpleasant and exacerbate anxiety.”</p> <p>Another video suggests depression is caused by alcohol, tobacco, MSG, caffeine, sugar and hydrolysed wheat. Modlin said that although lifestyle factors can contribute, “this framing is overly simplistic and potentially misleading”, since there are complex interwoven factors, including genetics and neurobiology, psychosocial stressors, childhood adversity, medical conditions and personality styles.</p> <p>Other clips promote supplements including saffron, magnesium glycinate and holy basil extract to ease anxiety. Although the psychiatrist Famia Askari said there are some studies showing benefits to some of these, there is not sufficient consensus for these to have become part of clinical practice – they are also manufactured supplements, in contrast to the “natural” claims that featured.</p> <h2>Anecdotal evidence</h2>  <p>Two videos recommend admission to psychiatric units based on personal experience, including one suggesting someone had considerably improved after six days, and another offering a template for children to ask their parents to have them admitted.</p> <p>Poulter said this was “misleading” and can “create misconceptions” about the benefits of inpatient admission. “Inpatient admission can in fact create and reinforce maladaptive coping mechanisms,” he said. “It is also very rare that someone would be driving themselves into mental health hospital in the way depicted by the video.”</p> <p>Another video depicts someone in a hospital gown in what appears to be a psychiatric ward stating: “I was too honest with my psychiatrist.” This could be harmful as it is “potentially encouraging people to not be honest and open with healthcare professionals about their mental health”, said Poulter.</p> <p>In another clip, a woman gives her strategies for managing anxiety, including eating an orange in the shower. “There is no evidence-base for eating citrus in the shower as a means to reducing anxiety, and I would worry that this would lead on to an ever-increasing spiral of unusual behaviours,” said Okai.</p>","source":"The Guardian","author":""},{"id":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/31/more-than-half-of-top-100-mental-health-tiktoks-contain-misinformation-study-finds","title":"More than half of top 100 mental health TikToks contain misinformation, study finds","description":"Guardian investigation reveals promotion of dubious advice, questionable supplements and quick-fix healing methods","imageUrl":"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c56f5fc8042537534d9603f19981242fa85bff4/480_0_4800_3840/500.jpg","category":"Mental Health","date":"2025-05-31","content":"<p>More than half of all the top trending videos offering mental health advice on TikTok contain misinformation, a Guardian investigation has found.</p> <p>People are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/08/health-misinformation-online-tips\">increasingly</a> turning to social media for mental health support, yet research has revealed that many influencers are peddling misinformation, including misused therapeutic language, “quick fix” solutions and false claims.</p> <p>Those seeking help are confronted with dubious advice, such as eating an orange in the shower to reduce anxiety; the promotion of supplements with a limited evidence base for alleviating anxiety, such as saffron, magnesium glycinate and holy basil; methods to heal trauma within an hour; and guidance presenting normal emotional experiences as a sign of borderline personality disorder or abuse.</p> <p>MPs and experts said the findings that social media platforms were riddled with unhelpful, harmful and sometimes dangerous mental health advice were “damning” and “concerning”, and urged the government to strengthen regulation to protect the public from the spread of misinformation.</p> <p>The Guardian took the top 100 videos posted under the #mentalhealthtips hashtag on TikTok and shared them with psychologists, psychiatrists and academic experts, who took a view on whether the posts contained misinformation.</p> <p>The experts established that 52 out of 100 videos offering advice on dealing with trauma, neurodivergence, anxiety, depression and severe mental illness contained some misinformation, and that many others were vague or unhelpful.</p> <p>David Okai, a consultant neuropsychiatrist and researcher in psychological medicine at King’s College London who reviewed the anxiety- and depression-related videos, said some posts misused therapeutic language, for example using wellbeing, anxiety and mental disorder interchangeably, “which can lead to confusion about what mental illness actually entails”, he said.</p> <p>Many videos offered general advice based on narrow personal experience and anecdotal evidence, which “may not be universally applicable”, he added.</p> <p>The posts reflected how “short-form, attention-grabbing soundbites can sometimes overshadow the more nuanced realities of qualified therapeutic work” on social media. The videos also over-emphasised therapy. “While there is strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of therapy, it’s important to emphasise that it’s not magic, a quick fix or a one-size-fits-all solution,” he said.</p> <p>Dan Poulter, a former health minister and NHS psychiatrist who reviewed the videos about severe mental illness, said some of them “pathologise everyday experiences and emotions, suggesting that they equate to a diagnosis of serious mental illness”.</p> <p>“This is providing misinformation to impressionable people and can also trivialise the life experiences of people living with serious mental illnesses.”</p> <p>Amber Johnston, a British Psychological Society-accredited psychologist who reviewed the trauma videos, said that while most videos contained a nugget of truth, they tended to over-generalise while minimising the complexity of post-traumatic stress disorder or trauma symptoms.</p> <p>“Each video is guilty of suggesting that everyone has the same experience of PTSD with similar symptoms that can easily be explained in a 30-second reel. The truth is that PTSD and trauma symptoms are highly individual experiences that cannot be compared across people and require a trained and accredited clinician to help a person understand the individual nature of their distress,” she said.</p> <p>“TikTok is spreading misinformation by suggesting that there are secret universal tips and truths that may actually make a viewer feel even worse, like a failure, when these tips don’t simply cure.”</p> <p>TikTok said videos were taken down if they discouraged people from seeking medical support or promoted dangerous treatments. When people in the UK search for terms linked to mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder, or neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism, they are also directed to NHS information, TikTok said.</p> <p>Chi Onwurah, a Labour MP, said the technology committee she chaired was investigating misinformation on social media. “Significant concerns” had been raised in the inquiry about the effectiveness of the Online Safety Act in “tackling false and/or harmful content online, and the algorithms that recommend it”, she said.</p> <p>“Content recommender systems used by platforms like TikTok have been found to amplify potentially harmful misinformation, like this misleading or false mental health advice,” she added. “There’s clearly an urgent need to address shortcomings in the OSA to make sure it can protect the public’s online safety and their health.”</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat MP Victoria Collins agreed the findings were “damning”, and urged the government to act to keep people safe from “harmful misinformation”.</p> <p>Paulette Hamilton, the Labour MP and acting chair of the health and social care select committee, said mental health misinformation on social media was “concerning” . “These ‘tips’ on social media should not be relied upon in place of professional, suitably qualified support,” she said.</p> <p>Prof Bernadka Dubicka, the online safety lead for the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said that although social media could increase awareness, it was important that people were able to access up-to-date, evidence-based health information from trusted sources. Mental illness could only be diagnosed through a “comprehensive assessment from a qualified mental health professional”, she added.</p> <p>A TikTok spokesperson said: “TikTok is a place where millions of people express themselves, come to share their authentic mental health journeys, and find a supportive community. There are clear limitations to the methodology of this study, which opposes this free expression and suggests that people should not be allowed to share their own stories.</p> <p>“We proactively work with health experts at the World Health Organization and NHS to promote reliable information on our platform and remove 98% of harmful misinformation before it’s reported to us.”</p> <p>A government spokesperson said ministers were “taking action to reduce the impact of harmful mis- and disinformation content online” through the Online Safety Act, which requires platforms to tackle such material if it was illegal or harmful to children.</p> <p><em>• In the UK, the charity <a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/\">Mind</a> is available on 0300 123 3393 and <a href=\"https://www.childline.org.uk/\">Childline</a> on 0800 1111.

Meanwhile, psychological distress was increasing across the population, and patterns of substance abuse and other modern stressors had made things worse.</p> <p>Ian Korbel, a psychiatrist not part of the inquest, tells Guardian Australia he once worked in a mental health outreach team that would respond to people in crisis. But that program stopped running in the mid-2000s.</p> <p>Korbel says the team that worked in Sydney’s eastern suburbs used to check the beaches for people experiencing homelessness. Cauchi was reportedly sleeping rough there before the attack.</p> <p>Korbel says the faltering of services has resulted in the buck passing to police and the justice system. “They’re in the punishment business,” he says. “They shouldn’t respond to this, but the health system isn’t resourced to respond to it.”</p> <p>Police are increasingly responding to such crises.</p> <p>The inquest heard that in New South Wales, police responded to 40% more mental health incidents in 2022 compared with four years earlier. </p> <p>Sen Sgt Tracey Morris told the inquiry: “We will always look at [those incidents] from a policing lens. That may lead to charges and them going through the court system when [it’s] effectively because of the mental illness.”</p> <p>Morris works as the mental health intervention coordinator in the Queensland police district where Cauchi’s parents live, in Darling Downs. The day Cauchi’s mother spoke to police, they referred Joel to her role – which helps people link in with health services – for a follow-up check. But the officer acting in her role while she was on leave missed the email. This moment to get Cauchi help was described by a psychiatrist at the inquest as a “missed opportunity”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/24/is-the-inquest-into-the-bondi-junction-murders-further-stigmatising-schizophrenia\">Is the inquest into the Bondi Junction murders further stigmatising schizophrenia?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fighting back tears, Morris told the court this was no reflection on that officer’s capability, but a direct consequence of under-resourcing. At least four people should be doing her job in that particular police district, she said.</p> <p>One of the cruelest ironies of that under-resourcing issue came during the inquest in a blink-and-you-might-have-missed it-moment, where Morris said no one was covering her role while she was at the inquest for the week. She couldn’t find anyone to backfill it.</p> <p>Matthew Morgan, an expert in policing mental health responses who lectures at the Australian Catholic University, says: “The only people really to blame here is the government.

There is a clear patten, he says. “The state has really just failed them.</p> <p>“There’s just lots of patterns of sporadic treatment, lack of follow-up care, and then the police get blamed for their criminalising and sometimes lethal response to such situations.”</p> <h2>‘Years of neglect’</h2> <p>The inquest heard there had been multiple improvements in crisis response since police spoke to Cauchi and his mother in January 2023.</p> <p>Police can connect with health professionals to get advice on incidents, and there are co-response models where healthcare workers respond to call-outs alongside police.</p> <p>Those changes – as Peggy Dwyer, counsel assisting the coroner, pointed out in the inquest – have come after multiple inquiries, internal police and government reports and coronial inquests. All make a similar recommendation: health professionals should respond to mental health crises, not police – at least not alone.</p> <p>Joining calls for this change are families whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/10/family-of-fatal-nsw-police-shootings-call-for-independent-inquiry\">loved ones have been shot dead</a> by police while they were suffering a psychosis. One of the loudest recent voices has been Judy Deacon, the mother of Jesse, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/sep/20/nsw-police-shooting-mother-demands-mental-health-reform\">who police shot dead in Glebe</a> in 2023 after reports he was self-harming.</p> <p>But co-responder models have not been rolled out nationwide, despite recommendations to do so. The leading model in NSW, known as Pacer, operates in just 20 of NSW’s 57 police commands.</p> <p>During the inquest, Dwyer asked Dr Brendan Flynn, the executive director of the mental health branch of NSW Health: “Why has there not been an expanded Pacer across NSW where sufficient demand is demonstrated, when this report came out almost four years ago?”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/22/just-16-million-labor-mental-health-package-spent-next-financial-year\">Less than 2% of Labor’s promised $1bn mental health funding would be spent next financial year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Flynn responded: “It’s a resourcing issue. It would require new funds, and that’s a matter primarily for government.”</p> <p>Later Dwyer asked: “Is there a risk that we just then get stuck here for another four years where there’s no rollout of more supports?<strong>”</strong></p> <p>Flynn replied: “I hope very much that’s not the case.” </p> <p>Even if a version of Pacer were rolled out across NSW, Korbel says, more work needs to be done. </p> <p>“Nowhere in Australia do we fund mental health as we should,” he says. “NSW is the worst. It gives 5% of its health budget to mental health.”</p> <p>Korbel says that figure “would need to be doubled at least” to match similar programs in countries such as England and Canada.</p> <p>Investment in health services can save money in the long term.</p> <p>Prof Olav Nielssen, a Sydney-based psychiatrist who appeared before the inquest, spoke about a supported housing charity he works at. It supports people revolving between hospital, prison and the homeless sector.</p> <p>He estimated the cost of having people in supported housing was a tenth of what it would otherwise cost having them bouncing around a network of hospitals, prisons and other institutions. He said NSW had “plans” to have 70 of these beds but that there should be 1,000 to meet the need.</p> <p>Elizabeth Young, the mother of Jade Young, a victim of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bondi-junction-stabbings\">stabbings</a>, appeared before the inquest and described her 47-year-old daughter’s murder as the “stuff of nightmares”.</p> <p>She also described it as the result of “years of neglect” within the mental health system.</p> <p>“It seems to me that my daughter and five others were killed by the cumulative failures of numbers of people within a whole series of fallible systems.”</p> <p><em>• In Australia, the crisis support service <a href=\"https://www.lifeline.org.au/\">Lifeline</a> is 13 11 14.

Every new “surprise” – from not being able to use tampons, to an almost constant cycle of UTIs – felt all the worse for my lack of mental and practical preparation.</p> <p>This shouldn’t be the case: around a half of all women will have some degree of pelvic organ prolapse in their lifetime. There are four types: vaginal, uterine, bladder and rectal, all of which involve one or more pelvic organs descending into the vagina. Often, it creates an internal bulge, but when it is more progressed it can be externally visible too. Prolapse being so varied – and, crucially, understudied – makes for a great proliferation of potential symptoms which are, in my opinion, generally underplayed in healthcare literature. Living with an organ descending into your vagina is frequently described as “uncomfortable”, as though comparable to wearing a too small pair of jeans. The NHS website describes what can be truly debilitating stress urinary incontinence (SUI) as “<a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pelvic-organ-prolapse/\">problems [with] peeing</a>”. What little information is available on prolapse seems designed to remind you that what you’re experiencing <em>is no big deal! </em>But for many of us, that is far from the case.</p> <p>My own prolapse was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/feb/10/urogynecologist-childbirth-interview\">caused by childbirth</a>, but it can also be brought on by injury, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/menopause\">menopause</a>, age, or for simply no (as yet known by medical research) reason at all. You might have none of the symptoms and no idea you even have it; conversely, you might have all of the symptoms and yet struggle to get a diagnosis. Six years on and, while I have a general diagnosis of “pelvic organ prolapse”, I do not know <em>which</em> prolapse I have, to what degree or whether or not I have multiple prolapses. Though I’m far from content with this shocking lack of information about my condition, I – through necessity – focus on what I <em>do</em> know, to get through the day. Here is everything I have learned, and everything I wish I had already known about living with pelvic organ prolapse, before I had to.</p> <h2>Penetrative sex <em>will</em> be different</h2> <p>When I was first diagnosed with prolapse, I didn’t think about the effect it might have on my sex life. But, as it turns out, this is probably the area of my life that’s been most negatively affected. Yes, I have stress urinary incontinence (SUI) – but when is the <em>worst</em> <em>time</em> to lose control of your bladder? Yes, I have pain in my vagina – but when is the <em>worst</em> <em>time</em> to feel pain in your vagina? At 29, and after a couple of nightmarish attempts at intercourse, I thought I’d never be able to have penetrative sex again; the pain was more than I could bear.</p> <p>With time, however, I realised that positioning was key. Having sex on my side so that the penis would not penetrate so deeply made a huge difference. Of course, this is no good if you get off on deeper penetration – for this, a friend advises placing a cushion under your bum, to lift your pelvis up and cause your cervix to recede. We both agree that lube is a huge help in encouraging the penis to “find the path of least resistance”. And as for the SUI? I pee beforehand, even if I don’t think I really need to. For others who may be embarrassed about losing control of their bladder, I’d recommend having sex in the bath or lubed up to the nines – both blessedly simple ways to disguise bigger or smaller leaks.</p> <h2>… and so will your period</h2> <p>While prolapse shouldn’t affect your period, your period <em>can </em>affect your prolapse. I certainly notice an increased heaviness in my vagina and, in the days before my period arrives, I feel particularly reluctant to overexert myself physically. I now experience cramping more intensely in my vagina, perhaps due to the descent of my uterus, and I have to apply heat pads to my vulva rather than abdomen (over clothing, to prevent the risk of burns). I have found using tampons and Mooncups next to impossible; my prolapse simply squeezes them out almost as soon as I insert them. Returning to pads after a decade of not using them was disheartening for me personally, and I have yet to find a brand of period pants I can get on board with. All of this caused me to turn to the coil – which has, at least, helped to alleviate my physical symptoms. It’s not for everyone, though, and while I did not experience pain with insertion myself, I would recommend anyone concerned about this to ask their healthcare provider to use a local anaesthetic gel or spray (pain relief is not routinely offered for IUD fittings).</p> <h2>Your relationship to exercise will change</h2> <p>These days, it is generally only in the lead-up to my period, or after some particularly physical exertion, that my prolapse affects my mobility – but this was not the case for the first year or two. On the worst days, merely standing up felt like a monumental effort – I’d have to squeeze my pelvic floor muscles as hard as I could to combat the sense that my cervix was going to tumble out of me. Physiotherapists told me I shouldn’t pick up my baby– almost laughably impossible advice for a new parent – which left me questioning every cuddle. Friends who like to run took news of their prolapses particularly hard. One found herself unable to run 10 metres without losing full control of her bladder; incontinence pads were a gamechanger, once she was able to get past the stigma. Another option is a pessary – a small ring inserted into the vagina to help support the organs above it.</p> <h2>You may have more gynaecological infections</h2> <p>A risk that comes with pessary use, however, is the increased chance of vaginal infections. This is due to the pessary potentially introducing bacteria into the vagina, but prolapse in general is likely to increase infections. UTIs are the most common, as the descended organs can prevent the complete emptying of the bladder, or create small leaks and pooling of urine, which is a breeding ground for bacteria. After penetrative sex, residual semen can become trapped in the pockets created by the prolapse, also creating fertile ground for infection. It may seem that the answer to these problems is more rigorous hygiene standards, but introducing harsher products and rougher cleaning habits can actually have an adverse effect on the vaginal ecosystem. I have yet to come up with a better solution than regularly purchasing over-the-counter vaginal self-testing kits and requesting targeted medication from my GP, if needed. This is time consuming and expensive, and I hope that GPs will consider offering free self-testing kits for regularly occurring gynaecological infections in future.</p> <h2>It may affect your future fertility options</h2> <p>A number of healthcare professionals informed me that if I don’t want my prolapse to get any worse, I should not get pregnant again. Avoiding vaginal birth by having a caesarean section wouldn’t help, in my case, as the pressure put on my pelvic region by carrying another baby could be enough to greatly worsen my symptoms and future outlook. Surgical repair will only be offered to me once I’ve decided not to get pregnant again. </p> <p>It’s important to note that not all sufferers of prolapse are told that they should not become pregnant: it is judged on a case-by-case basis, and if you are prepared for your prolapse to potentially worsen then, of course, you can always go ahead with it, no matter what you are advised. But having to calculate that risk can be difficult for many. There is growing evidence to suggest that pessary use in pregnancy for those with advanced prolapse can lead to best post-birth outcomes, but more research into this and other interventions is sorely needed in order to provide as much reproductive choice as possible.</p> <h2>The mental toll can feel impossible – but it isn’t</h2> <p>When I was first diagnosed with prolapse, I didn’t want to leave my bed. Partly, this was because every step I took felt like it was making things physically, medically, worse. But mostly, it was because of the mental toll that having a prolapse had taken on me. Doctors seemed to barely understand my condition, and shrouded it in euphemisms. I had little idea what the rest of my life was going to look like, and I suddenly – after having a baby – felt entirely alienated from my body and the child I was advised not to pick up. This is, of course, fertile grounds for postnatal depression.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is important to acknowledge just how many people are in the same boat</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another demographic affected by pelvic organ prolapse are those experiencing menopause – people who, like those who have just given birth, are subject to vast hormonal fluctuations and are therefore more vulnerable to poor mental health. Understanding the psychological impact that gynaecological conditions can have must begin with understanding a key element of medical misogyny: that women’s health conditions are almost universally <a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/news/why-we-know-so-little-about-women-s-health\">understudied, undertreated, and underdiagnosed</a>. Women find themselves experiencing <a href=\"https://www.iasp-pain.org/advocacy/global-year/pain-in-women/\">more pain, and with less likelihood of diagnosis and treatment</a>. </p> <p>This can feel frustrating, like the system is stacked against us. But it is important to acknowledge just how many people are in the same boat; to campaign for better treatment options, and to work together to destigmatise conditions that are not talked about enough. Sharing my prolapse story with others, and then having so many people share their experiences with me, helped me to shed the shame I had initially felt at my body’s betrayal. Talking about how to achieve better sex, or how to manage my period, gave me a toolkit with which to move forward. We still need meaningful, institutional reform but, for now, I’m grateful not to be too ashamed to wear an incontinence pad if I need to.

The force said the change meant officers were attending crimes such as robberies faster, but mental health groups<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/may/09/met-police-policy-on-mental-health-calls-may-be-putting-lives-at-risk-say-charities\"> said they feared it could result in deaths</a>.</p> <p>May and two ex-health ministers, Syed Kamall and Frederick Curzon, have tabled amendments to the mental health bill going through parliament which, if passed, would lead to mental health nurses, psychiatrists or other doctors being called out to restrain and detain someone under the Mental Health Act. Those professionals would each become an “authorised person” who is allowed to detain someone under the act.</p> <p>May took an active interest in mental health issues during her time as home secretary and in Downing Street. She helped push through the principle that those detained under the act would no longer be held in police cells and would instead be taken to “places of safety”, usually at NHS facilities, as included in the new bill.</p> <p>But in a joint statement on Monday the eight groups said the risks posed by someone in a mental health crisis meant police officers must continue to always attend. The groups include the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Royal College of Nursing and the British Medical Association.</p> <p>At present, only police officers are permitted under the Mental Health Act to detain someone in a mental health crisis, for example because they are having a psychotic episode.</p> <p>The groups said: “Removing police involvement entirely has hugely dangerous implications, as entering someone’s home without permission is fraught with huge risks and is only currently done with the assistance of police intelligence. Without this, professionals may be entering homes without police help and therefore lacking crucial intelligence that could ensure their safety.”</p> <p>They added: “While we recognise the immense pressures faced by police services, we also acknowledge that mental health crises in the community are becoming increasingly acute and almost never occur without some level of risk.</p> <p>“The expertise, skills and equipment of the police remain essential for safely reaching individuals in crisis, especially where they may be in immediate danger to themselves, pose a risk to others or face a threat from others.”</p> <p>Dr Lade Smith, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “Detaining, and if necessary restraining, someone is essentially arresting them and to do this safely requires specialist skills and legal powers.</p> <p>“Expecting clinicians whose role is to provide therapeutic care to arrest people in the street or burst into their homes if they notice someone suffering a mental health crisis is simply inappropriate and indicates a lack of understanding of what health professionals do.”</p> <p>Chief constables are backing the change. They want to see responsibility for dealing with mental health crises become split between their officers and NHS staff.</p> <p>A National Police Chiefs’ Council spokesperson said: “We support the proposed amendments to the mental health bill, which will enable authorised medical professionals to effectively deal with some mental health incidents. This will ensure vulnerable people receive the most appropriate care without feeling criminalised because of their mental health issues.”</p> <p>They added: “We will always attend incidents where there is a risk of serious harm to the individual or attending professionals, or where criminality is involved.”</p> <p>The groups opposed to the plan also include the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&amp;E doctors, the College of Paramedics, the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, the British Association of Social Workers and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services.</p> <p>The Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan, the party’s former shadow cabinet minister for mental health who is also an A&amp;E doctor, voiced unease about the plan.</p> <p>She said: “I am concerned that these amendments aim to turn practitioners into enforcers and could expose healthcare staff to increased danger. It runs the risk of eroding trust in dedicated and hard-working mental health staff by delegating police powers to them.”</p> <p>Ministers are also against the change. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Extending police powers to other professionals would represent a major shift in the roles, responsibilities and practice for health and care staff and would place additional resource on an already stretched NHS at a time where we are trying to rebuild a health service fit for the future.</p> <p>“It also raises questions around whether it is right for the health and social care professionals to have powers to use reasonable force, which could have implications for patient, public and staff safety, as well as potentially damaging the relationships clinicians have with patients.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 6 June 2025 to clarify that the proposal for those detained under the Mental Health Act to not be held in police cells, and to be taken instead to “places of safety”, is included in the new bill. </p> <p><br></p>","source":"The Guardian","author":""},{"id":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/23/nhs-to-open-network-of-mental-health-emergency-units-across-england","title":"NHS to open network of mental health emergency units across England","description":"Patients feeling suicidal or experiencing psychosis or mania will be able to walk in or be referred to units designed to ease pressure on A&amp;Es","imageUrl":"https://media.guim.co.uk/789a03e49fa7e4cb37cee2de6e8951334cb7501f/0_0_5400_4320/500.jpg","category":"Mental Health","date":"2025-05-23","content":"<p>The NHS is to open a network of mental health accident and emergency units across England in an attempt to ease the pressure on overcrowded hospital A&amp;Es and emergency services.</p> <p>Patients feeling suicidal or experiencing symptoms such as psychosis or mania will be able to walk in or be referred by GPs and the police to the departments.</p> <p>The units will be staffed by specialist doctors and nurses providing around-the-clock support.</p> <p>Ten NHS trusts have opened dedicated units for mental health emergencies, the Times reported, and the scheme is expected to be expanded nationally as part of the 10-year NHS plan being published this summer by Labour.</p> <p>Sir James Mackey, the chief executive of NHS England, told the Times: “Crowded A&amp;Es are not designed to treat people in mental health crisis.

Since the accident in 1999, he has been living off disability allowances provided by his former employer in Huainan, Anhui’s coal city. But in 2024 Zhang was sent to hospital once again – this time to a psychiatric ward.</p> <p>Zhang was sectioned for 22 days in June after he protested outside the office of his former employer, demanding an increase in his disability allowance. “I endured more than 20 days of humiliation in there. There was no phone, and my belt and shoelaces were taken away,” Zhang said in a recent interview with Chinese media. Zhang said that he was forced to take medicines and tied to his bed for several hours a day. After the three weeks in hospital, he was sentenced to eight days of administrative detention for “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/28/china-should-scrap-picking-quarrels-says-leading-lawyer\">picking quarrels and provoking trouble</a>”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/02/i-was-very-lucky-activist-and-blogger-lu-yuyu-on-escaping-china\">‘I was very lucky’: activist and blogger Lu Yuyu on escaping China</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After <a href=\"https://m.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_30562269\">local media</a> picked up Zhang’s case, his story went viral.

They were swiftly arrested and Zhang was later taken to a psychiatric hospital. Their hands and feet were tied to the bed and they were forced to take medicine twice a day. “I tried not to swallow those pills by hiding the medicine between my teeth and my cheek and spitting it out afterwards,” Zhang recalls. Zhang says that their parents were persuaded to consent to the treatment after the police said that Zhang’s gender identity – Zhang identifies as non-binary – could represent a mental illness.</p> <h2>A system ripe for abuse</h2> <p>China’s mental health law, passed in 2012, allows authorities to detain “troublemakers” without the consent of the person or their relatives. A person may be involuntarily hospitalised if they pose a risk of harm to themselves or others. Other countries, including the UK, have similar legal provisions. But in China, many fear that the system is ripe for abuse as there are few checks and balances. A recent <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr46npx1e73o\">BBC investigation</a> found that criticising the Chinese Communist party could be grounds for a psychiatric diagnosis.</p> <p>Huang Xuetao, a lawyer who is an expert on the treatment of mentally ill and disabled people, says that the law should be reformed so that no one can be deprived of their rights. “The idea behind ‘being labelled mentally ill’ implies that it is unjust to deprive civil rights from someone without a mental illness – but acceptable if the person truly has one. This very mindset sustains the structural trap within the psychiatric system. Those who hold such beliefs are complicit. Unless this belief is fundamentally challenged, abuses of psychiatry that violate human rights will inevitably continue,” she says.</p> <p>Zhang Youmiao was detained for seven days before being released, although they were later sectioned again for 15 days, without the consent of their parents. The doctors had been sympathetic, with one even quietly suggesting to Zhang that they could apply for political asylum in a foreign country. “That was something I’d never heard of,” Zhang says. “I didn’t view my behaviour as political, I was just protecting my rights.”</p> <p>Chinese law states that if a person is hospitalised involuntarily, they should have a diagnosed psychiatric condition. Zhang says they didn’t receive a formal diagnosis in either of their spells in hospital. They do not have hospital records from that time, but provided documentary evidence to support other elements of their account.</p> <p>Zhang never formally complained about their treatment. “I was frightened, I was afraid of being put into jail or a psychiatric ward again. I even doubted myself, I thought that maybe I was the root cause of the problem”.</p> <p>Zhang left China in 2023 and is now applying for asylum overseas.</p> <h2>‘Why can’t I point out what they did wrong?’</h2> <p>Others have sought accountability from the Chinese system. More than 100 people attempted to bring legal cases related to involuntary hospitalisation against hospitals, police or local governments between 2013, when the mental health law was enacted, and 2024. Few succeed.</p> <p>In 2024, Shenzhen-based lawyer Zeng Yuan sued her local public security bureau after she was sectioned for four days after a dispute with local police. Zeng had smashed a sign in the police station, venting her frustration at their failure to help her contact her estranged father and handle a barrage of online harassment she had been receiving in relation to her job. Zeng lost her case, despite the fact that the Shenzhen health commission ruled that her medical records and behaviour “did not fully support a diagnosis of severe mental disorder”.</p> <p>Zeng represented herself in her legal case. “If you directly accuse the government of violating the law, it’s basically impossible to find a lawyer in the commercial field who will represent you,” she said. Huang’s NGO, the Equity and Justice Initiative, used to provide legal aid to people bringing civil rights complaints, often funded with the help of donations from overseas. But tightened laws on foreign funding “has severely impacted our ability to do these cases”, she said.</p> <p>Some victims turn instead to the court of public opinion. After Zhang Po went to the media with his story, the local city government said they would investigate his complaint. Zeng publishes blog posts on WeChat about her experience, which are swiftly censored. But she remains hopeful that public pressure might have an impact. “Maybe one day in the future, the court can overturn the verdict,” Zeng says. “Since I’ve experienced such behaviour, why can’t I point out what they did wrong? I don’t need to swallow my anger. I don’t need to remain silent.”</p> <p>China’s ministry of public security and national health commission could not be reached for comment.</p> <p><em>Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu</em></p>","source":"The Guardian","author":""},{"id":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/23/afl-mental-health-round-illness-stigma","title":"AFL urged to go beyond mental health round with player voices to tackle stigma","description":"Experts call for sharing of first-person stories to better reach community after pleas for themed round return in wake of Adam Selwood’s death","imageUrl":"https://media.guim.co.uk/405ec0faaeafdccf318c36a86250afbd7263b685/505_0_4801_3841/500.jpg","category":"Mental Health","date":"2025-05-22","content":"<p>From sharing more first-person stories to using destigmatising language in community football, the AFL can do more to improve mental health outcomes according to experts, whether or not the league pursues a themed round explicitly dedicated to the cause.</p> <p>The footy community has been beset by grief this week following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/17/former-west-coast-player-adam-selwood-dies-months-after-twin-brothers-death\">death of West Coast premiership player Adam Selwood at age 41</a>, three months after his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/04/troy-selwood-brisbane-lions-afl-player-death\">twin brother Troy – a former Brisbane player – died by suicide</a>.</p> <p>Former Kangaroos and Swans player Wayne Schwass, Cats great Jimmy Bartel and Swans’ premiership-winning coach Paul Roos have been leading voices in the call for the establishment of a mental health round, but others including former Hawthorn president and Beyond Blue founder Jeff Kennett are opposed to the idea.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2025/may/19/adam-selwood-robert-walls-grief-magnificent-triviality-of-sport\">A week of grief is a reminder to reflect on the magnificent triviality of sport | Jonathan Horn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As many as 43% of people aged 16–85 experience a mental disorder at some time in their life according to the ABS, and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has found suicide is the leading cause of death for people aged 15-44.</p> <p>The AFL developed its first mental health strategy in 2020 and updated it last year, outlining a vision that employees of the AFL and its clubs are “supported to thrive in football, work and life”.</p> <p>The league partners with six mental health organisations including the Black Dog Institute, which worked with St Kilda on “Spud’s Game”. That initiative raises money for mental health programs and builds a legacy from the life of former Saints captain and Tigers coach Danny Frawley, who died in 2019 after ongoing mental health challenges.</p> <p>Black Dog Institute chief scientist and executive director, Sam Harvey said the time for awareness “has passed, what we need now is coordinated, sustained action”.</p> <p>“There is more to do, particularly in supporting the broader community, including ex-players, and to promote crucial mental health research so that we can better understand why mental ill health continues to rise in Australia,” Harvey said.</p>    <p>The AFL Players Association (AFLPA) offers counselling to current and former players and their partners and wrote to members this week to reiterate the wellbeing services available. In 2024, 429 former players or their partners took up the offer, a 24% rise on the previous year.</p> <p>There are also dedicated programs and entities operating within the broader AFL sector. Tackle Your Feelings was formed by the AFL Coaches Association and the AFLPA in 2018, and provides a free mental health training program for players, community AFL coaches, and club support staff. Fifth Quarter is an independent not-for-profit supporting AFL and AFLW past players, their families and the community to achieve positive mental health and wellbeing.</p> <p>The AFL reported a record 528,000 registered Australian football participants in 2024. Dr Judith Griffiths, director of the Australian Association of Psychologists (AAPi), said there were opportunities for the AFL to effect wider change by using its influence in community footy.</p> <p>“This could include embedding programs, training, and language that destigmatised mental health, partnering with community groups to create culturally safe content, using storytelling, visible champions, and inclusive messaging to shift community norms, using peer champions from underrepresented groups to train as mental health ambassadors and avoiding assumptions about gender and sexuality,” Griffiths said.</p> <p>Examples of destigmatising language provided by AAPi include mental health is “something we all need to think about”, that it “exists on a spectrum”, “it’s ok if you’re feeling anxious today” and “sometimes we might be thriving, sometimes we might be feeling challenged”.</p> <p>Beyond Blue chief executive Georgie Harman said both the AFL playing group and broader Australian community face similar challenges and would benefit from similar approaches.</p> <p>“That is, initiatives that are designed and set out to reach people early, before they reach crisis point,” Harman said.</p> <p>“Our analysis shows that, like the broader mental health system, the football world offers a wide range of programs of services, but it can be confusing to know which one to access and when, what programs work best, and how all they all fit together.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/17/former-west-coast-player-adam-selwood-dies-months-after-twin-brothers-death\">Former West Coast player Adam Selwood dies months after twin brother’s death</a> </p> </aside>  <p>SANE chief executive Rachael Green said research was “very clear” that one of the best ways to address stigma is through relatable, first-person stories.</p> <p>“Having high-profile sports people talk about their mental health challenges can not only help people experiencing mental ill health see they are not alone, it can also reverse harmful misconceptions about mental illness amongst the general public,” she said.</p> <p>Green called on the the AFL to consult widely before embarking on any activity “to ensure the benefits outweigh the risks”.</p> <p>“We also encourage [the] AFL to look beyond just a few elite level games,” Green said. “Any meaningful campaign needs to be distilled down to community level to have the impact it needs to have.”</p> <p><em>• In Australia, support is available at <a href=\"https://www.beyondblue.org.au/\">Beyond Blue</a> on 1300 22 4636, <a href=\"https://www.lifeline.org.au/\">Lifeline</a> on 13 11 14, and at <a href=\"https://mensline.org.au/\">MensLine</a> on 1300 789 978.

According to research by the charity Rethink Mental Illness, people are <a href=\"https://www.rethink.org/news-and-stories/media-centre/2025/02/new-analysis-of-nhs-data-on-mental-health-waiting-times\">eight times more likely to wait more than 18 months</a> for mental health treatment than for physical conditions.</p> <p>The government is also prioritising NHS reforms and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/sep/25/liverpool-shows-labour-how-long-term-sickness-blights-lives-and-the-economy\">cutting waiting lists to boost employment</a>, aiming to boost economic growth and cut the benefits bill, amid record numbers of working-age adults leaving the workforce due to health issues.</p> <p>Official figures show there were about <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/2024/10/englands-nhs-mental-health-services-treat-record-3-8-million-people-last-year/\">3.8 million people in England in contact with NHS mental health</a>, learning disability and autism services in 2023-24, up almost two-fifths compared with before the pandemic.</p> <p>Prudon said that in the Netherlands about 1 million people are in contact with the health service with a mental health issue. To reduce waiting times by one month, he said about 100 additional psychiatrists or psychologists would be required at an approximate annual cost of €10m (£8.4m).</p> <p>Due to the larger population, in the UK four times as many extra mental health professionals would be required. However, Prudon said the savings for Rachel Reeves’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/14/ministers-mission-washing-spending-plans-in-effort-to-avoid-cuts\">stretched budget</a> and the economy would considerably outweigh the costs.</p> <p>He added: “The issue of waiting times is not new, both in the UK and the Netherlands. This has been an issue for at least a decade. But what’s lacking in the debate so far, is that people are saying: ‘OK, it’s the treatment that’s important. But the government has limited funds, we can’t keep on spending money.’ However, there is also an economic case to be made.</p> <p>“It is not a case that we’re just losing money if we invest more in mental health. In the long run this would save the country quite a lot of money by retaining more people in the workforce.”</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “This government inherited a broken mental health system, with too many people on waiting lists being held back from employment. Our shift towards prevention, together with our welfare reforms, will help more people return to work and boost economic growth.</p> <p>“We are transforming mental health services through our Plan for Change, by investing an extra £680m this year, hiring more staff, delivering more talking therapies and cutting mental health waiting lists.”</p>","source":"The Guardian","author":""},{"id":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/20/mental-health-lessons-school-dont-work-mindfulness","title":"Mental-health lessons in schools sound like a great idea.

She explains to me that she does this at school. She lies on her back with the rest of the class and they do something called the body scanner, where they all pay attention to various body parts in turn. I know she is describing a mindfulness exercise, because I’m a psychologist who researches mental-health lessons. I listen as she explains it all to me, but in my head I’m thinking something else: she shouldn’t be learning mindfulness at school.</p> <p>On the face of it, mental-health lessons in schools seemed like an excellent idea. Young people’s mental health <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/03/youth-mental-health-crisis-happiness-un-uk-us-australia\">is worse now</a> than it was in the past, and one-to-one treatment is hard to access. If you teach young people about mental health at school – which often includes teaching techniques based on therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or mindfulness – it’s more accessible. If you teach these concepts to everyone in a class – so-called universal interventions – you avoid missing the under-the-radar kids who aren’t seeking help, and avoid the potential stigma of singling anyone out. If you teach the information when pupils are young enough, even better: you might prevent mental-health problems from starting in the first place.</p> <p>At least, that was the idea. The reality is more sobering. Researchers have now run many studies testing the impact of universal school mental-health interventions and have found that they don’t really improve mental health. When improvements are found, they’re <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735821001227\">small</a> – a tiny average shift on a symptom questionnaire – and the <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2025-60428-001.html\">quality</a> of the research is often poor, meaning it’s hard to trust the findings. The best-designed studies <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/abs/evaluating-the-effectiveness-of-a-universal-ehealth-schoolbased-prevention-programme-for-depression-and-anxiety-and-the-moderating-role-of-friendship-network-characteristics/745721E4F8E63892095BB0551F267F7F\">show</a> that interventions <a href=\"https://mentalhealth.bmj.com/content/25/3/99\">don’t</a> <a href=\"https://mentalhealth.bmj.com/content/28/1/e301426\">work</a> at all: <a href=\"https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/camh.12572\">no improvement</a> in mental health symptoms, either immediately after the course of lessons or later down the line.</p> <p>In fact, some studies have found that universal mental-health lessons actually make things worse. There are now high-quality studies showing that school lessons based on <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/evaluating-the-effectiveness-of-a-universal-ehealth-schoolbased-prevention-programme-for-depression-and-anxiety-and-the-moderating-role-of-friendship-network-characteristics/745721E4F8E63892095BB0551F267F7F\">CBT</a>, <a href=\"https://mentalhealth.bmj.com/content/25/3/117\">mindfulness</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796723001560\">dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/education-for-wellbeing-programme-findings\">general mental-health awareness</a> lead to a small increase in symptoms of mental-health difficulties. There is evidence of other bad outcomes too, such as <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10802-023-01043-2\">decreased prosocial behaviour</a> or <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796723001560\">decreased relationship quality</a> with parents.</p> <p>It is not every study, but it is <a href=\"https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/camh.12760\">enough</a> that we should take this seriously – not least because all schools in England are now <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/mental-health-and-wellbeing-support-in-schools-and-colleges#:~:text=Curriculum%20teaching%20and%20learning,-The%20government%20conducted&amp;text=All%20pupils%20are%20taught%20about,next%20steps%20later%20in%202025.\">required to teach</a> something about mental health. And these are the ones that have been tested: there are many, many interventions being sold to and taught in schools that haven’t been evaluated at all.</p> <p>I have now <a href=\"https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/camh.12753\">reached the conclusion</a> that we should stop these all-class mental-health lessons. My view is that the only information we should teach en masse is where a young person should get help, both inside and outside school, if they’re struggling. That’s it. Then we should focus the time, energy and money on supporting the smaller group of young people who are actually unwell.</p> <p>I have not come to this conclusion lightly. Like so many others, I was once enthusiastic about the potential of the universal approach. It is a logical, intuitive idea that mental-health lessons in schools are a good idea, an obvious solution to an obvious need. But once you can accept the evidence, something surprising happens. It starts to become clear why all-class mental-health lessons don’t improve young people’s mental health, and why they were never going to.</p> <p>In any one classroom, young people vary enormously. For starters, the majority of them do not have mental-health problems. This means some pupils are being asked to engage in effortful practices at home – mindfulness meditation, CBT-based thinking exercises – when they are not struggling in the first place. When you ask them in qualitative studies, where they can convey openly what they think, some young people say such lessons are <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212657023000053\">irrelevant to them</a>, and they are right. Proponents of these lessons would say that the exercises are still worth learning, that positive effects may appear later down the line – but this is not supported by the evidence.</p> <p>At the other extreme, in every class there will be students who already have significant mental-health problems, and thus will need more<em> </em>than what is on offer in universal lessons. They will need focused one-to-one support: therapy tailored to their specific challenges, built on a meaningful, trusting relationship with a qualified adult. Others will need changes in their external circumstances, not guidance about how to cope better in their own minds. For these students, mental-health lessons will be far too light touch, like being given plasters and paracetamol when they have a broken leg.</p> <p>Other students say that these lessons make them focus on <a href=\"https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-2368-z#Sec20\">negative feelings</a> and memories, which then <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12310-023-09591-0\">upsets them</a>. Others simply do not understand what they are being taught, and find the exercises confusing and stressful. We have very little understanding about how specific groups – such as neurodivergent children or those with language difficulties – experience these all-class lessons and whether they are able to correctly implement what they are being told to do.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/07/exam-leave-support-teens-exam-pressures-parents\">I won’t be taking exam leave to support my teens – just hovering, worrying and driving them mad | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another problem is that the classroom may not be the right <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642115/\">setting</a> to learn about mental health. Some young people feel socially secure at school and have good friends, but others are lonely or bullied. Many young people do not feel safe at school. In one study, several students <a href=\"https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/133872/\">said</a> they didn’t want to do mindfulness meditation at school because they didn’t trust what their peers would do to them if they shut their eyes. Hearing this, it suddenly seemed obvious: without resolving these social challenges, the classroom is just not the right environment for a young person to do vulnerable work on their mental health.</p> <p>Importantly, this doesn’t mean there should be no mental-health support in schools. School is a logical, equitable place to provide help, and there is <a href=\"https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jcpp.13209\">evidence</a> that one-to-one and small-group support in schools, given to those who need or want it, can work well, at least in the short term. But when it comes to all-class lessons, we should listen to the evidence, and to young people themselves. We came up with a good idea, we spent a lot of time and money testing it, and we have our answer. Given the evidence, we should now stop doing those lessons.</p> <p>The people running this research, and those making decisions to teach these lessons in schools, really want a solution to this crisis. We all want to figure out what to tell young people about mental health, and how to best help them when they are struggling. Against a backdrop of ever rising mental-health problems, and lack of affordable alternatives, I completely understand why it feels wrong – unethical even – to call a halt to these lessons.</p> <p>Yet it is also unethical to ignore evidence, and to continue delivering something that doesn’t work. At best, the universal lessons we have are a waste of time; at worst, they are harmful. The numbers tell us these lessons don’t improve mental health. The qualitative data tells us that many young people don’t like or want them.

Here’s what experts say.</p> <h2>What is creatine?</h2> <p>Creatine is a compound the body naturally makes in the liver, kidneys and pancreas. We can also get it from animal proteins like red meat, fish and chicken. It acts as a quick fuel source for muscles, helping regenerate adenosine triphosphate, or ATP – a molecule cells use for energy.</p> <p>“If we keep it super simple, the body has three sorts of energy systems,” says Dr Imtiaz Desai, a Sydney, Australia-based exercise physiologist.</p> <p>Creatine helps power short-duration, high-intensity activities like sprinting or lifting, and also those requiring moderately sustained energy, like tennis or hockey. But it doesn’t do much for prolonged, slow-burn energy like the kind you need to run a marathon.</p> <p>If you’re doing resistance training, it helps muscles work harder for a little longer. “It should enable you to do a few more repetitions at the same weight,” says Desai.</p> <p>Most people don’t need creatine supplements for general health – the body makes enough, aside from in rare and serious <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3794/\">cases</a> of genetic creatine deficiency disorder. Nonetheless, the fitness-minded often take it to optimize their workouts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\" data-alt=\"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ \"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Synthetic creatine comes in different formulations, but creatine monohydrate is the most studied, with the strongest evidence for efficacy. It’s widely available, often sold as a flavorless, grainy white powder, and affordable: dosages vary based on personal goals, but a typical daily serving of five grams might cost about 50 cents (38p).</p> <h2><strong>Is creatine safe?</strong></h2> <p>In healthy adults, creatine is considered safe even for <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2025.1578564/full\">long-term</a> use – it’s one of the most <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8949037/\">researched</a> supplements available.</p> <p>While the UK regulates dietary supplements, in the US, the Food and Drug Administration does not vet the accuracy of supplement contents, so it’s possible for products to be contaminated with other substances or contain less creatine than advertised. Products with the <a href=\"https://www.nsf.org/knowledge-library/what-is-nsf-certification\">NSF seal</a> are more reliable, as they have been tested by a third-party certifier.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/12/do-you-feel-proud-when-you-succeed\">Do you feel proud when you succeed – or just relieved?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Creatine is known to cause minor side-effects like bloating or stomach pain. These can be more pronounced in people taking higher doses, such as 25 or 30 grams a day, in a dubious practice known as “<a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/creatine-loading-phase\">loading</a>”.</p> <p>“There’s no need for a loading phase,” says Dr Avinish Reddy, a Los Angeles-based physician with a longevity-focused practice.</p> <p>Higher doses of creatine create more waste for the kidneys to filter, so people with kidney issues should check with a doctor before starting the supplement, says Reddy. Recently, creatine “loading” was linked to <a href=\"https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6264415/v1\">acute kidney injury</a> in a 17-year-old boy.</p> <p>It’s best to take creatine mixed into a liquid, like juice, water or a smoothie, as opposed to “dry-scooping”, an influencer stunt in which people eat straight creatine. This method <a href=\"https://www.garagegymreviews.com/can-you-dry-scoop-creatine\">risks powder inhalation and choking</a>, along with worse GI effects.</p> <h2>Does creatine actually help build muscle?</h2> <p>The short answer: not as much as the hype suggests.</p> <p>Desai led a 12-week <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/6/1081\">study</a>, published this March, in which two groups of people began a weight-lifting regimen. One group used creatine, the other did not. There was no meaningful difference in results: people in both groups gained approximately two kilograms of lean body mass on average.</p> <p>In the short term, creatine draws water into muscles, which can cause a couple of pounds of temporary weight gain and make muscles look more full. “There’s a short-term change in body-water content,” says Desai, who posits that past <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10180745/\">studies</a> that found small benefits with creatine supplementation may have overestimated creatine’s relationship with muscle growth by not accounting for this water retention.</p> <p>Desai says it’s possible that longer studies might provide more information about creatine’s muscle-building benefits over time. It is also possible that creatine may indirectly boost muscle growth by allowing people to train harder. “If you’re able to do more repetitions, then over time, we would expect you to see an added benefit,” Desai says.</p> <p>But don’t expect an overnight change. “You’re not going to pack on pounds of muscle within a few weeks,” he says, nor will adding creatine to an otherwise sedentary lifestyle yield results.</p> <h2>Who benefits most from creatine?</h2> <p>Creatine is often associated with athletes looking for an edge, but supplementation also can be helpful for older adults experiencing muscle loss. “Women experience a lot of muscle mass and strength loss after menopause,” says Reddy, who often recommends a standard daily dose of three to five grams of creatine to patients. It can help with resistance training and post-workout <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34199588/\">recovery</a> by activating satellite cells, which repair muscle fibers after injury caused by use.</p> <p>Vegetarians and vegans who supplement with creatine may also see greater improvements in their workouts and energy levels, since their diets contain less natural creatine.</p> <p>However, researchers estimate that about 20%-30% of people are “<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15320650/\">non-responders</a>” to creatine due to physiological factors like genetics.</p> <h2>Can creatine support mental health?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-020-0741-x#Sec9\">Researchers</a> are exploring whether creatine may help ease depression symptoms by <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1424972/full\">supporting</a> brain energy, memory, attention and information processing speed, and promoting <a href=\"https://www.psychiatrypodcast.com/psychiatry-psychotherapy-podcast/episode-238-creatine-mental-health-benefits\">dopamine and serotonin</a> production.</p> <p>Dr David Puder, Florida-based psychiatrist and host of the Psychiatry &amp; Psychotherapy podcast, sees creatine as a promising tool in treating depression. It is not necessarily a standalone solution, but can be part of a broader, physician-led approach to treating depression, along with therapy and optimizing diet, exercise and sleep.</p> <p>“Studies to date have shown that creatine seems to amplify the speed at which people recover [from depression] by a little bit,” says Puder. “Not a lot, but a measurable improvement,” he says, particularly in clinical trials pairing creatine with medications such as Lexapro or cognitive behavioral therapy.</p> <p>It may be that creatine’s exercise-boosting effects also support mental health. “Exercise improves the ability to come out of depression,” says Puder, so better workouts “may allow for an independent improvement in depression beyond what the creatine is doing in the brain”.</p> <p>While creatine may help alleviate the mental fatigue that comes with depression, Puder says that in people with bipolar disorder, there is some risk of it contributing to hypomania. If you are interested in starting creatine, you should talk to your doctor beforehand.</p> <h2>Is creatine safe for young people?</h2> <p>While creatine itself is generally safe for adults, most medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, <a href=\"https://health.choc.org/should-teens-use-creatine/\">recommend against</a> creatine use for those under 18 due to unknown long-term effects. However, there are no age restrictions on who can buy creatine, and a 2024 <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a62567487/should-teens-take-supplements/\">review</a> found 26% of adolescent boys said they had taken creatine at some point.</p> <p>The University of Toronto researcher Dr Kyle Ganson also cautions that creatine use by teens can be part of a broader pattern.</p> <p>Ganson recently <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39173400/\">studied</a> a cohort of 912 teenagers and young adults. He found that those who used creatine, particularly young men and boys, were more likely to develop muscle dysmorphia – an obsessive drive for size and muscularity that can lead to psychological fallout.</p> <p>“It’s not causal,” says Ganson. “Just because you take creatine, you’re not going to develop a mental health condition.” But it may be a sign that a young person is becoming overly focused on body image.</p> <p>Ganson urges parents to exercise “respectful curiosity” about their child’s goals with the supplement, and to talk to a doctor or dietitian, especially if their child’s focus on physical appearance seems to be disrupting other areas of their life.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 16 May 2025 to describe NSF as a certifier, rather than a regulator.</p>","source":"The Guardian","author":""},{"id":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/13/mental-health-crisis-waiting-a-and-e-england","title":"People in mental health crisis waiting up to three days in A&E in England","description":"Royal College of Nursing findings described as ‘a scandal in plain sight’ with with conditions ‘close to torture’","imageUrl":"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f8db404b76e6b52b351343a12296ee54cc5c83c/333_43_3274_2619/500.jpg","category":"Mental Health","date":"2025-05-13","content":"<p>Thousands of people in a mental health crisis are enduring waits of up to three days in A&amp;E before they get a bed, with conditions “close to torture” for those in such a distressed state.</p> <p>At one hospital, some patients have become so upset at the delays in being admitted that they have left and tried to kill themselves nearby, leading nurses and the fire brigade to follow in an attempt to stop them.</p> <p>A&amp;E staff are so busy dealing with patients seeking help with physical health emergencies that security guards rather than nurses sometimes end up looking after mental health patients.</p> <p>The findings are included in research by the Royal College of Nursing.

Many become distressed and I totally understand why. I think if I was sat in an A&amp;E department for three days waiting for a bed I would be distressed too.”</p> <p>The director of nursing at a London trust said the “brightly lit, noisy” environment in her A&amp;E was “close to torture” for those in mental distress and that patients often got so frustrated that they left.</p> <p>A senior nurse in the south-west of England said: “Lots of people will just come and wait and be patient. But as you can imagine, some of them are in severe crisis. They want to leave. They want to self-harm. They are massively distressed and struggling.”</p> <p>In 2019 Manchester Royal Infirmary had no 12-hour waits before finding a bed for a mental health patient after a decision had been made to admit them. But last year 463 experienced such a delay, the RCN found.</p> <p>Alexa Knight, the director of England at the Mental Health Foundation thinktank, said the findings showed that too few people with mental ill health were receiving help soon enough after they started struggling. She said the NHS needed to ramp up provision of community-based early intervention services, to reduce the risk of people ending up in such crisis that they went to A&amp;E.</p> <p>Ranger urged ministers to ensure “urgent and sustained investment in community mental health nursing [to] ensure everybody gets timely care in the right place”.</p> <p>The NHS statistics obtained by the RCN seriously underestimate the extent of waits longer than 12 hours and also the number of people seeking help at A&amp;E for a mental health emergency. That is because only 26% and 52% of the 145 NHS trusts from which they sought information provided figures on those two issues.</p> <p>Minesh Patel, the associate director of policy and campaigns at the mental health charity Mind said: “Long wait times in A&amp;E can be difficult for everyone. But for the people attending A&amp;E in mental health crisis – and more than 700 do every day – the impacts can be significant.</p> <p>“When people may have attempted suicide, self-harmed, or experienced psychosis, they need timely and urgent help. They are being let down by a system that is overwhelmed and depleted.”</p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “People with mental health issues are not getting the support or care they deserve, and we know that many NHS staff feel burnt out and demoralised, having been overworked for years.</p> <p>“That’s why this government is investing an extra £680m in mental health services this year, to help recruit 8,500 more mental health workers, and put mental health support in every school.</p> <p>“We have also launched one of the world’s first 24/7 mental health crisis support services via NHS 111 and announced a £26m investment in new crisis centres, to ensure patients can get timely support from a trained mental health professional.”</p> <p><em>• In the UK and Ireland, <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/\">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

She also spoke with Meghann Burke, the executive director of the NWSL Players Association (NWSLPA). In time, she decided on a different course of action: In the 2023 offseason, Dorsey became the first player to utilize the NWSL’s mental health leave policy, which allows its players to take six months away while receiving their salary in full. In that time, Dorsey attempted to regain a stability she felt like she had lost, eventually returning to the league with the Utah Royals last season.</p> <p>“That instability really determined the decisions and how I went about my life,” Dorsey said. “I think going through leave and having this perspective, I’ve kind of taken control of my life in a lot of ways. I needed to step away to take care of myself, and I’m truly so grateful that I did.”</p> <p>Dorsey may have been the first to utilize the NWSL’s mental health leave policy, but she was certainly not the last. Since Dorsey in 2023, more players have publicly stepped away to prioritize their mental health. Carly Nelson did so in 2024, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DEqIssEhFcf/\">later alleging</a> “emotional and psychological abuse” on the part of her club, who she left at the expiration of her contract. So too did Racing Louisville’s Bethany Balcer and Angel City’s Sydney Leroux in 2025. Others presumably will follow them.</p> <h2>How mental health leave came to be</h2>    <p>The policy has been in place since 2022, when it was included in the collective bargaining agreement between the NWSL and its players’ association. It was the first of its kind in women’s soccer worldwide.</p> <p>“The overall protection of the players, the person and mental health, was a really big proponent of the CBA,” said Madison Pogarch, Utah Royals defender and vice-president of the NWSLPA. “We really set a standard for people to be like: ‘it’s okay that you can’t do it every single day, all the time, and it’s okay to take a break.’”</p> <p>That 2022 CBA was agreed upon as multiple investigations were unfolding in the wake of a reckoning with systemic abuse within the league in 2021. At the deal’s signing, Burke said that “Players drove every decision in this process.”</p> <p>In 2024, the NWSLPA negotiated a new CBA with the league. That one made headlines for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/29/quiet-rise-of-rookies-shows-benefit-nwsl-decision-ditch-draft\">abolishing the college draft</a> – a first for any major US pro league. However, the deal also includes even more mental health support for the players. The 2025 NWSL season is now the first where every team is also required to have both a mental health provider and a mental health performance consultant available to players.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/29/quiet-rise-of-rookies-shows-benefit-nwsl-decision-ditch-draft\">Quiet rise of rookies shows benefit of NWSL’s bold decision to ditch draft</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Having this support for your players is unprecedented,” said Pogarch.</p> <p>The new mental health performance consultants operate on a strictly confidential basis, must hold a master’s or doctoral degree in sport science or psychology, and be certified. They must also be available to players for “a reasonable amount of time.”</p> <p>Though there is no requirement for the players to visit them one-on-one, these specialists are available to do so. They are inside the environment, observing the players’ experiences first hand while also holding workshops and presentations that promote mental skills and well being.</p> <p>For Gotham FC general manager Yael Averbuch-West, these new requirements are just the minimum. Her team and Bay FC are two in the NWSL that have added a full time mental performance coach to their teams, who travel with the squad on matchdays.</p> <p>“When we look at a 360 view of health, there’s a mental, emotional, spiritual, you could add in so many aspects of a player’s health,” said Averbuch-West. “I think individualization is key. I think that is the gold standard, or North Star, or whatever you want to call it, when it comes to all aspects of health, well being and performance … I don’t claim that we have unlocked the whole puzzle here. But I do think that is a very important area of focus in every team environment.”</p> <h2>Advocating for players</h2>    <p>Averbuch-West, who played in the NWSL and in Sweden, uses her personal experience to help bolster the club’s approach.</p> <p>“I reflect back on a personal level, and so the things that maybe I could have done to better advocate for supporting my own mental health,” she said.</p> <p>Today, that’s where someone like Agustina de Giovanni would come in. De Giovanni is Bay FC’s full time mental performance specialist, but first and foremost, she views herself as working for the players.</p> <p>“I advocate for the athletes, that’s my main focus,” she said. “For us, [it’s] understanding their needs, and helping them develop the tools that they believe they need.”</p> <p>De Giovanni sees the mental side of soccer as just as important as the physical and the tactical. The only difference is that the brain is engaged for far more often than a muscle might be in the gym.</p> <p>“If you want the same consistency, you have to train this muscle. You <em>need</em> to train this muscle,” she said. “The problem is that this muscle, you are using it all the time. My mission, in my job, in my role, is to bring awareness of how this is important.”</p> <p>De Giovanni also believes the next step for developing a better mental health support system will be integrating it even further into U.S. soccer’s coaching license courses. In her mind, once it becomes more common in the high performance environment, the stigma that still surrounds mental health specialists will be removed.</p> <p>She also acknowledges that the NWSL presents unique challenges due to the size of the United States. An away match in the NWSL could incur over 12 hours of total travel time over a three or four day period. All that time spent in the high-performance bubble adds up.</p> <p>“Mental health support for the players is no different to physical care. The only difference is that there isn’t an objective diagnosis that can be given like with a fracture or a sprain,” De Giovanni said.</p> <p>“We need to bring the same awareness [to mental health support] that we bring to everything else. It’s nothing about being ‘crazy’. We have problems, yes, but it’s not because you’re ‘crazy’. You’re working on your mind.”</p> <h2>What’s next</h2> <p>The players’ CBA may guarantee them the right to take leave, but the NWSLPA’s mental health focus isn’t limited to the players currently rostered by the league’s teams. Pogarch says that the union is offering lifetime memberships for players that want to keep accessing resources after they retire.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/29/how-barbra-banda-got-caught-up-in-a-swirl-of-misinformation-and-double-standards\">How Barbra Banda got caught up in a swirl of misinformation and double standards | Suzanne Wrack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I think a lot of people are always trying to have a plan before you have to hang up your boots because you never know when the last day is going to be,” Pogarch said.</p> <p>For Dorsey, the benefit of the program was not just in the time it allowed her to take away from the game, but also in the insight it provided about the environment of professional sports, and how her own personality exists within it. Looking back, Dorsey now realizes that she can trace her mental health struggles to her rookie season and the transition into turning professional. Those first insecurities that she felt as a new player in a cutthroat, high-pressure environment intensified over the years until it became unsafe.</p> <p>“That was a really challenging transition,” she said. “I think that was a really important part of my mental health journey. I was already feeling like I was struggling just to get my feet under me.”</p> <p>Whether it was the pressure of competing for a contract, getting cut, or the fear of getting injured, the consequences of Dorsey’s performance became unhealthy.</p> <p>Today, a NWSL rookie facing similar issues will have somewhere to turn.</p>","source":"The Guardian","author":""},{"id":"https://tools.cdc.gov/api/embed/downloader/download.asp?m=132608&amp;c=761182","title":"CDC continues to note illnesses despite product recalls and asks consumers to check for recalled foods in &lt;em&gt;Listeria&lt;/em&gt; outbreak linked to prepared meals","description":"CDC urges people to check their refrigerators and freezers for recalled foods.

The death of two is just incomprehensible.</p> <p>“The town needs to band together now and understand that this has happened.”</p> <p>Holland said one of the officers who had entered the home had returned to work, but a second young officer was “not doing as well” and was being supported by the force.</p> <p>“The actions of the young police officers involved has been above heroic,” he said.</p> <p>“They’ve done a fantastic job. They need to be commended for what they did.

The court heard some districts didn’t even have one dedicated full-time mental health officer, despite that being recommended in a 2017 inquiry.</p> <p>The court heard that Morris was unable to find another officer to backfill her role while she was giving evidence during this week’s inquest at Lidcombe coroners court.</p> <p>She was due to take three weeks of leave soon, but there was only someone backfilling for one week.</p> <p>The court heard that, had Morris been at work when the email was sent requesting a follow-up for Cauchi, she would have either called or met with the Cauchi family to discuss their options.</p> <p>She told the court she would have searched Cauchi’s history in the police database and discovered he had had three interactions with police for erratic driving.</p> <p>The court heard she also would have learned that in July 2022, Cauchi had repeatedly called a boarding school asking if he could watch female students undertake sporting activities.</p> <p>The database would have also shown that in 2021, police visited his share house after reports he was screaming and stating he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and off his medication.</p> <p>Morris told the court that part of her follow-up would have included “immediately” reaching out to her Queensland health counterpart to learn about their engagement with Cauchi.</p> <p>The court heard on Tuesday that Cauchi had been weaned off medication by a psychiatrist and was meant to be monitored – but wasn’t.</p> <p>Morris said there was also an issue with resourcing in the wider health sector for people suffering a mental health crisis.</p> <p>She said such people were increasingly dealt with by police because they had nowhere else to turn.</p> <p>“We are attending to people with so many vulnerabilities that have no other avenue to seek help other than call triple zero.

In all honesty, I slightly rolled my eyes: I grew up in India, where pranayama (the breath work that is a crucial part of yoga practice) is fundamental and powerful; I couldn’t imagine needing an accessory of any kind to support it. That is, until I popped open the lid and took a deep breath – the fragrance of mint and thyme soothes and calms me, virtually transporting me to an English garden. It’s an immediate connection to nature via scent. And it’s addictive. Nothing can compare with yoga for grounding the mind, body and soul, but this little jar of breathing balm is a great hack for when you’re just too tired or jet-lagged, or need a pick-me-up on a long flight or car journey.<strong><br></strong><strong>Divia Thani</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>global </strong><strong>editorial </strong><strong>director, </strong><strong>Condé Nast </strong><strong>Traveler</strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Calm patches</h2>    <p><strong>Calm Patches</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.rossbarr.com/products/calm-patches\"><sub>£15 for 10 at Ross J Barr</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://victoriahealth.com/calm-patches/\"><sub>£15 for 10 at Victoria Health</sub></a></p> <p>A life-affirming addition to my daily wellness toolkit.

Whereas other non-prescription treatments focus on exfoliation or oil control, this one treats the root cause of acne by killing the bacteria responsible (<em>Cutibacterium </em><em>acnes</em>). It’s relatively gentle. Many of my patients have struggled with spots for years, only to see dramatic improvements within weeks of using it. I have acne and keep a tube in my bathroom drawer to use between cleansing and moisturising when I have a breakout.

On one side is traditional farmland, close-cropped grazing, uniform grasses, neatly tended hedges and a sparsity of trees, a farmscape ubiquitous across England. On the riverbank opposite, rougher, less uniform grasses grow unevenly between trees, thistle and brambles, in a chaos of natural disorder swaying in the breeze towards the reedbeds below.</p> <p>The land on the <a href=\"https://www.sharphamtrust.org/about-us/our-vision\">Sharpham</a> estate side of the River Dart used to be a mirror of the traditional farmscape on the opposite bank. It hosted a non-organic dairy farm and a vineyard, within a tightly controlled 18th-century heritage landscape of deforested parkland.</p> <p>But five years ago the managers of the trust began a process of nature restoration within the 223-hectare (550-acre) site in south Devon, with a vision of tackling the twin crises of the 21st century: a rise in people suffering from mental health conditions and a catastrophic loss of the natural world.</p>    <p>Sharpham, an estate created by a naval sea captain made wealthy from a plunder of Spanish treasure, had for years hosted Buddhist-inspired retreats, where people came to seek help with mental resilience, cope with trauma and feel grief. But after taking over as director of the estate, Julian Carnell, a teacher and conservationist, looked at the landscape and felt a conflict.</p> <p>“I was conscious that people were coming on mindful retreat here, but there was a disconnection with how we were managing the land,” said Carnell. “I wanted to do something a bit more holistic with the land and combine really our mental health work with our conservation.</p> <p>“Policymakers tend to see nature as a headache, something to get their way around. But a<strong> </strong>lot of people are struggling in their own lives, whether it is the cost of living crisis or stress, or mental health – there are 8.7 million people on antidepressants, and huge waiting lists for counselling. We have turned things round to show that … [nature] is a fantastic resource to support people, and those people then go on to want to care for it.”</p> <p>To connect with as many people as possible, the nature restoration on the estate, which is run as a social enterprise, was designed with access for people in mind so that the environment could be used as therapy in a seamless way.</p> <p>In a protected heritage landscape, Carnell and Jack Skuse, his rewilding partner and the director of <a href=\"https://www.ambios.net/\">Ambios</a>, had to be mindful of the past. “We had to balance the heritage designation with our environmental ambitions, so what we are doing is pushing the envelope a bit,” said Carnell. “We are returning to something more like wooded pastureland.”</p>    <p>They secured a national lottery heritage grant for the nature restoration project and visited the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/26/knepp-estate-why-the-king-and-queen-of-rewilding-are-farming-again-after-20-years-aoe\">Knepp estate</a>, where Isabella Tree and Charlie Burrell pioneered rewilding, and turned the conventional 1,416-hectare (3,500-acre) farm into a place thrumming with wildlife in barely two decades.</p> <p>Carnell and Skuse scanned 18th-century maps of the estate, replanted trees in original locations, planted orchards, removed the vineyard and replaced it with a wildflower meadow, opened up viewpoints, improved access and rebuilt a bridge.</p> <p>“We wanted our story to be about education and outreach,” said Skuse, whose company trains people in nature conservation. “We are living through catastrophic declines in wildlife and something fundamental has to change. We brought schoolchildren in, we brought farmers here and got them talking, to try inspire and reassure them.</p> <p>“We used this beautiful storytelling landscape and pioneered a change in land use from dairy farm and vineyard, into something that prioritises wildlife and nature recovery.”</p>    <p>Twelve months in, the transformation was already visible. As a thick, uneven sward of vegetation took over the valley, providing structure and cover for wildlife, the land came alive. “You walked through the fields and the small animals like voles and mice were spilling out everywhere, bouncing and popping up and down all over the place. Their population exploded,” Skuse said.</p> <p>In the second year, the predators came. “We have barn owls foraging every day across the fields, picking out the small animals, kestrels hovering above the ground and diving into long grass, and now breeding on site, which we have never had before.”</p> <p>There are sightings of ospreys, one of the largest birds of prey in the UK, which is on the at-risk register because of its historical decline and low breeding numbers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/28/government-failing-to-support-natural-regeneration-of-trees-in-england\">Government ‘failing to support natural regeneration of trees in England’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today nature restoration spreads across 61 hectares (150 acres), with regular butterfly, bird, vegetation and tree surveys carried out by Skuse and his team. There have been notable wins: a flock of 500 goldfinches, drawn to the food source from the grass and thistles; the appearance of the common whitethroat, which is on the amber list of the birds of conservation concern; stonechats, which are normally coastal, feeding and breeding on site; and curlews nesting. Each year, the surveys show consistent rises in butterflies. “These are big changes to what was otherwise a fairly standard farmland,” said Skuse.</p> <p>The rewilded landscape is now a source of the therapy offered at Sharpham. “We are here as a mental health charity to connect people to nature,” said Carnell.</p> <p>Carnell is in touch with NHS professionals to help tackle the crisis in retention of staff in the service. Last year GPs and primary healthcare staff from Brighton and Hove Federation were given the opportunity to attend the nature retreats.</p>    <p>“I cannot tell you the impact, it is extraordinary,” said Dr Rachel Cottam, a GP in Brighton who attended a mindfulness retreat at Sharpham.</p> <p>“People feel that they are more calm and less stressed, but they also feel it enables them to touch into their original motivation for going into this caring work, which can be so hard, and to find joy again. I am sure it not only improves the way they work but trickles into improved patient care,” she said.</p> <p>Since the nature restoration project began at Sharpham in 2020, the political narrative has changed. While Labour promised before the election to preserve Britain’s natural beauty and reverse environmental degradation, the rhetoric from Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves now sets nature against growth and the government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/05/farmers-in-england-fear-for-nature-after-sustainable-farming-funding-frozen\">halted environmental grants for farmers</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the government’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/17/benefit-cuts-will-push-more-people-into-poverty-warns-citizens-advice-boss\">benefits cuts</a> coincide with <a href=\"https://www.rethink.org/news-and-stories/media-centre/2025/02/new-analysis-of-nhs-data-on-mental-health-waiting-times/\">mental health waiting lists stretching up to 18 months</a> or more.</p> <p>Carnell believes that Sharpham’s most powerful response over the next five years is to continue to show nature as a powerful restorative and preventive prescription to keep people healthy and resilient.</p> <p>“If you look at the various crises we face – the biodiversity crisis, the climate crisis, the mental health crisis – we tend to think about them in silos,” said Carnell. “But they are all interrelated, so we need a much more coherent, holistic approach.”</p>","source":"The Guardian","author":""},{"id":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/15/uk-riots-led-to-deterioration-in-asylum-seekers-mental-health-says-report","title":"UK riots led to deterioration in asylum seekers’ mental health, says report","description":"Mental Health Foundation says civil unrest last summer left many fearful of attacks by far-right protesters","imageUrl":"https://media.guim.co.uk/656ab00a8ae48176eedc9c35fb4c2f7a5d418bef/0_202_3000_1800/500.jpg","category":"Mental Health","date":"2025-04-14","content":"<p>Last summer’s riots, which took place after the murder of three girls at a Southport dance class, led to a deterioration in the mental health of asylum seekers, with many becoming fearful of walking down the street in case they were targeted by far-right protesters, according to a report.</p> <p>The report from the Mental Health Foundation, published on Tuesday, identified a decline in the mental health of asylum seekers as a result of the civil unrest and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/04/rioters-try-to-torch-rotherham-asylum-seeker-hotel-amid-far-right-violence\">attacks on hotels</a>, compared with the state of their mental health when they published a similar report in February 2024.</p> <p>Mark Rowland, the chief executive of the Mental Health Foundation, said: “One key development since our last report has been that the racist riots of summer 2024 had a terrible impact on the mental health of many people seeking asylum in UK. Some people told us they were scared to leave their accommodation, risking increased isolation, and others said they feared they’d be attacked walking down the street just because of the colour of their skin.”</p> <p>He added: “The climate of hostility has increased, especially on social media which played a key role in escalating tensions. Disinformation and racist rhetoric have surged, especially on platforms like X, with some of those who spoke to us reflecting they’d see hate within minutes of logging on to the website. More action needs to be taken by the UK government to stem the impact of disinformation and hate both online and offline.”</p> <p>The report also called for asylum seekers to have the right to work in any job if the Home Office has not processed their claim within six months, arguing that this would not only boost asylum seekers’ mental health but also increase tax revenue for the Treasury. The data is based on <a href=\"https://niesr.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Annual-Research-Report-2024.pdf?ver=lpoH6mxDyp5XiBuIUmPf&amp;utm\">calculations by the Institute of Economic and Social Research</a>.</p> <p>According to the figures, allowing asylum seekers to work after six months would save the country £4.4bn in government expenditure, grow the economy by £1bn, increase tax revenue by £880m, reduce the mental health impacts of worklessness and destitution on asylum seekers, promote better integration, and reduce dependence on taxpayer support.</p> <p>The report warned that preventing asylum seekers from getting jobs was leading to “workless stagnation”. It echoes the <a href=\"https://www.refugee-action.org.uk/lift-the-ban/#:~:text=%23LiftTheBan%3A%20give%20people%20seeking%20asylum%20the%20right%20to%20work&amp;text=Together%2C%20we%20believe%20we%20can,'\">Lift The Ban</a> campaign, a coalition of more than 300 charities, trades unions, businesses, faith groups and thinktanks, which have urged the government to allow asylum seekers to work in a broader range of industries.</p> <p>Under the current rules, only some asylum seekers who are qualified in shortage occupations can apply for jobs if their asylum claim has not been determined after a year. In practice this system bars many from working.</p> <p>Rowland added: “Giving asylum seekers the right to work is a no-brainer. Everyone – from asylum seekers, to businesses, to the government, to the NHS, to our communities – benefits when asylum seekers are given the ability to support themselves. The current system, which is both harmful and expensive, cannot continue as it is.”</p> <p>The foundation, which supports asylum seekers and refugees with their mental health, through programmes across the UK, also highlighted in the report the acute poverty faced by asylum seekers who sometimes have to make a choice between skipping meals or paying the bus fare for a vital appointment.</p> <p>Some felt the words “asylum seeker” stigmatised them. One child told researchers she hid the fact that she was an asylum seeker from her school friends for fear of being excluded by them if she told them about her immigration status.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: “While the wellbeing of those in the asylum system is important, we remain determined to continue cracking down on anyone working illegally in the UK, and we certainly have no intention of creating a fast-track process so that people who come to the UK outside the established work visa rules are simply allowed to ignore them.”</p>","source":"The Guardian","author":""},{"id":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxn1qxrr32o?at_medium=RSS&amp;at_campaign=rss","title":"Magnesium: Can this 'miracle mineral' really help us sleep?","description":"The global market in this supplement is worth almost £3bn - a figure set to nearly double over the next decade.","imageUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/e493/live/078ec460-b0ed-11f0-aa13-0b0479f6f42a.jpg","category":"Nutrition","date":"2025-10-24","content":"The global market in this supplement is worth almost £3bn - a figure set to nearly double over the next decade.","source":"BBC Health News","author":"BBC Health News"},{"id":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/08/friendship-benches-mental-health-support-sussex","title":"‘Friendship benches’ to offer free mental health support in Sussex","description":"Counsellors called ‘grandmothers’ and ‘grandfathers’ will provide listening ear through Zimbabwe-founded initiative","imageUrl":"https://media.guim.co.uk/eaa97a156607144c807dd37070057d4e39538be9/0_51_4032_2419/500.jpg","category":"Mental Health","date":"2025-04-08","content":"<p>People in Sussex who are depressed, lonely or anxious are to be offered free, easily accessible support through the Friendship Bench, a pioneering pilot spreading around the world.</p> <p>The Friendship Bench scheme, which involves a wooden park bench being placed in a public space, offers a listening ear, in the shape of so-called “grandmothers” and “grandfathers” to anyone passing.</p> <p>These lay counsellors receive just two weeks of training.

His company, The Gym Group, has rolled out Hyrox training sessions to about half of its 245 sites and prides itself on being the biggest club for the discipline in the UK.</p> <p>However, the silver-haired chief executive has a confession to make: he has never done a Hyrox competitive event, although he has done some training.</p> <p>“They’re quite demanding; that’s not to say I couldn’t do it,” he tells the <em>Observer</em> as we meet in the no-frills gym chain’s new site in Elephant and Castle, south London. “I’m old-school – I go on the treadmill and the rowing machines.”</p> <p>Hyrox is certainly not for the out of shape: participants have to perform eight 1km runs on a treadmill, each followed by a workout on a different station, such as the sled, sandbag lunge or wall ball.</p> <p>Launched in Germany eight years ago and touted as the sport for everybody, it has become particularly popular with twentysomethings, who post social media snaps of themselves training for races held around the world. Christian Yanga, the Elephant &amp; Castle gym manager, says their oldest member doing Hyrox is 75, while the youngest is 16.</p> <p>The craze is just one leg of a strategy has helped The Gym Group become one of the biggest players in the fitness sector. Founded in 2007 by the former England squash player and accountant John Treharne as Britain’s first budget, 24-hour gym chain, it has since grown to 951,000 members, with plans to open 50 more gyms in the next three years.</p> <p>Orr says the founder was inspired by what other no-frills players, such as Premier Inn and easyJet, were doing in their sectors. “It’s about really focusing on the things that matter … great equipment, a nice, big space that’s clean and safe and well run, and engineer out some of the things that are less important to people, like a receptionist, somebody laundering towels, and a swimming pool.”</p> <p>Initially backed by Phoenix Equity Partners and Bridges Ventures, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/09/the-gym-to-float-on-stock-market-with-valuation-of-250m\">the chain floated in London in 2015</a> and has a market value of £237m, down by a third since the IPO. Its main low-cost rival, PureGym, set up in 2009, is the biggest chain in the UK in terms of sites (412) and members (1.5 million). The Gym Group tried to merge with PureGym in 2014 but the deal was blocked by the competition&nbsp;watchdog.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Gyms and fitness are increasingly part of the identity of emerging generations. It’s part of how they want to live</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Today, one in six people aged 16 or over in the UK are members of a gym, and numbers are growing. Providers range from £200-a-month luxury health clubs, such as David Lloyd Leisure or Third Space, which offer hot yoga and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/26/fit-in-my-40s-cant-drift-off-reformer-pilates\">reformer pilates</a> at the top end, to Virgin Active and Fitness First in the middle, and PureGym and The Gym Group at the low-cost end, with contract-free membership from £14.99 a month and a £15 joining fee.</p> <p>The Gym Group’s sites are open around the clock – members can get in, with a code, to work out at 3am if they wish – with 24/7 CCTV monitored externally when there are no staff on site. The chain signed up to the mayor of London’s women’s night safety charter in 2022.</p> <p>In fact, there are now more 24-hour gyms than 24-hour licensed nightclubs in the capital, confounding predictions that the fitness sector might never bounce back from the pandemic boom in home&nbsp;workouts.</p> <p>Orr, who was headhunted from the <em>Times</em> to become chief executive of the company in August 2023, says that, as a no-contract business, it had to build its membership back from scratch after lockdowns. “But it came back very quickly. Like so many other businesses in that period, it was obviously a very, a very challenging time.”</p> <p>The future looks much more promising. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/03/gen-z-record-rise-uk-gym-membership-report\">Record numbers of Britons are going to the gym</a> to socialise while getting fit, a report from trade body UKActive said last week. It found that, since 2022, gym membership had risen by 1.6 million to 11.5 million people aged 16 and over, driven by generation Z.</p> <p>The fitness industry in the UK has grown by 3.5% between 2012 and 2024 to £5.9bn, according to data firm Leisure DB. Much of that was driven by low-cost gyms, which account for 15% of the market by value, up from 2% in 2012, and 28% of membership, up from 4% in 2012.</p> <p>Orr also credits a rise in “fitness IQ”, with people increasingly aware of the health benefits of exercise for mind as well as body. “Our members cite mental health as high as physical health in terms of the reason to join and the reason to stay,” he says. “And that’s a huge change: maybe 10 years ago, people weren’t talking much about mental health.”</p> <p>Gym-goers are roughly 60% male, 40% female with an average age of 30; two-fifths are gen-Z 18- to 24-year-olds, plus a big chunk of millennials, aged 26 to 41.</p> <p>“Gyms and fitness are increasingly part of the identity of emerging generations. It’s part of how they want to live, how they want to socialise, how they want to express themselves, both in the real world and in social media,” Orr says.</p> <p>“My 19-year-old son – when I was 19, I did occasionally go to the gym because I thought I ought to. He’s going every day because he wants to, which kind of amazes me.”</p> <p>Orr has had a varied career. Armed with an MBA from Imperial College London, he ran the ad agency WCRS for five years, which created the widely known <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/jun/03/orangeislayingtorest\">“The future’s bright, the future’s Orange” ad</a> to launch mobile phone provider Orange in 1994 (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/18/ee-phases-out-orange-mobile-brand-t-mobile-uk\">now part of EE</a>). He moved on to senior roles at British Gas and the RAC.</p> <p>In 2020, he became managing director of Times Media, where he oversaw the strategic development of the <em>Times</em> and <em>Sunday Times</em> across digital and print platforms. </p> <p>Lessons learned there about retaining interest have been applied to his current job, where there is a lot of churn in the first 45 days of someone joining. “It’s not uncommon in subscription businesses for the highest churn to be near the beginning. A subscription at the <em>Times</em> is no different in terms of that sort of fundamental dynamic,” he says.</p> <p>The chain, which employs 1,900 people, swung to an adjusted pre-tax profit of £3m last year, from a loss of £5.5m in 2023, with like-for-like revenues up by 7%. Orr expects the rise in employers’ national insurance, which came in on 1 April to result in a £1.3m hit – “very modest compared to Wetherspoons” or other leisure businesses.</p> <p>As an avid Fulham FC fan, Orr insists that this is the job he has enjoyed most. “I’ve always liked sport and fitness, and it’s not a difficult area to get excited about, because we make a positive difference to the UK.”</p> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Age </strong>54</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married with three sons.</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> St Paul’s school; Durham University; Imperial College London (MBA).</p> <p><strong>Pay</strong> Total package of £1.6m in 2024.</p> <p><strong>Last holiday</strong> Cornwall.</p> <p><strong>Best advice he’s been given</strong> “Lots of people are good at starting things.

Much of the increase in spending is linked to a huge rise in the number of working-age adults claiming disability benefits linked to mental ill health on a scale that demands a policy response. At the heart of the debate is the question of what has caused this increase and how it could be reversed.</p> <h2>Worsening mental health</h2> <p>In 2002, mental and behavioural problems were the main condition for 25% of claimants. By 2024, the figure had risen to 44%, with <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/publications/role-changing-health-rising-health-related-benefit-claims#:~:text=Since%20the%20pandemic%2C%20it%20has,by%20claims%20primarily%20for%20mental\">more than half (55%) of the post-pandemic rise in disability benefits</a> accounted for by claims primarily for mental health, according to a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) thinktank. The same report found “compelling evidence that mental health has worsened since the pandemic” and experts agree with this assessment.</p> <p>“We observe clear trends of increasing mental ill health,” says Dr Darío Moreno-Agostino, who researches population mental health at University College London and King’s College London. His team’s analysis of longitudinal data, tracking cohorts born in 1970, 1958 and 1946, suggests that fafter the pandemic <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004145\">all three generations reached or surpassed the worst mental health levels</a> in 40 years.</p> <p>“We don’t know exactly the reasons, but there are some clear candidates,” says Moreno-Agostino. “Socioeconomic adversity is one of the fundamental causes of mental health inequalities. I don’t think that there’s evidence that this is due to overdiagnosis.”</p> <p>NHS records reveal similarly stark trends. The number of people in contact with secondary mental health services rose by 600,000 between 2019 and 2024 – a 45% increase in five years, <a href=\"https://www.cqc.org.uk/publications/major-report/state-care/2023-2024/access/mh#:~:text=Data%20from%20the%20Mental%20Health,for%20by%20population%20growth%20alone.\">according to data from the Care Quality Commission</a>, which said the increase in appointments had not kept pace with this trend.

Rates of common mental disorders <a href=\"https://sphr.nihr.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/changes-in-depression-anxiety-and-stress-over-two-decades/\">more than doubled in 16- to 24-year-olds between 2000 and 2019</a> and have increased more steeply since then.</p> <p>As the NHS has struggled to keep pace, clinicians are witnessing a steady increase in the severity of cases, designated green, amber or red. “In the past we’d see a mixture of green, amber and red,” says Prof Daisy Fancourt, the head of the social biobehavioural research group at UCL. “Now it’s basically all red cases and a few amber. There isn’t actually the space to see the greens.”</p> <p>Fancourt, too, is sceptical that overdiagnosis is at play. “We’re going through extremely difficult times for young people,” she says. “Poverty, Covid disrupted young people’s lives at a critical time, the difficulty securing housing and employment, existential challenges, global strife, climate change. On top of that we have challenges around social media and increased availability of global news.”</p> <h2>Unequal diagnosis</h2> <p>There are also striking inequalities in who receives a diagnosis, according to a recent study by Prof Susan McPherson, a social psychologist at the University of Essex. The research found there were <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308279\">12 times as many people with “undiagnosed distress”</a> (symptoms severe enough to meet clinical diagnostic criteria) as there were people with diagnoses in the absence of clinically significant symptoms, using data from the <a href=\"https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/\">UK Longitudinal Household Study</a>. The “overdiagnosed” group was so small, McPherson says, that they were almost excluded from the analysis for statistical reasons.</p> <p>People living with a disability had nearly three times the risk of undiagnosed distress compared with those without a disability and women had 1.5 times the risk of being undiagnosed. Both these groups were also at greater risk of having questionable diagnoses (although in much smaller numbers) highlighting that over- and under-diagnosis coexist in a health system that, <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308279\">the study suggests</a>, is designed around “patriarchal and ableist concepts of normality”. “They can be misunderstood in both ways,” says McPherson. “It suggests that mental health services just aren’t geared up to meet their needs.”</p> <p>While her research undermines Streeting’s claim, McPherson is critical of an “over medicalisation” of mental health.</p> <p>“There’s a huge problem out there and we can’t make it go away just by saying it’s overdiagnosis. But diagnosing it all is not the solution either,” she says. “The answer is looking at the problem from a more social and economic perspective.”</p> <h2>Social and economic adversity</h2> <p>Speaking to experts, a recurring theme is the role of social and economic adversity in mental ill health and the NHS is grappling with how to reflect this at a time of widening inequalities. Social prescribing, which aims to improve the health and wellbeing of patients by connecting them to community resources and activities, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdrjmn1zjjro\">has tripled in the last three years</a>.</p> <p>“A lot of the time when people have milder problems there can be community-based solutions,” says Fancourt, who is running trials of social prescribing for young people on mental health waiting lists and in schools. Participants are offered six hour-long sessions with a link worker, who supports them in taking up hobbies, getting involved in volunteering, sport, social activities or dealing with practical challenges around transport or housing. The concept has faced some criticism, <a href=\"https://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/news/pulse-pcn/absence-of-evidence-to-support-social-prescribing-finds-major-review/#:~:text=A%20major%20review%20has%20found,or%20quality%20of%20care%20received.\">with one study of 6,500 people failing to identify evidence of efficacy</a> and concerns over whether patients might feel dismissed. Fancourt agrees that further research is needed, but said demand for the schemes had been far greater than anticipated.</p> <p>“It’s extremely popular across age groups,” she says. “It’s not a pill, it’s not a stigmatising treatment. People are building new identities that are based around their hobbies. It’s an asset rather than a deficit-based approach.”</p> <h2>The welfare system</h2> <p>There is also a question of how the welfare system has played a role in shaping the public conversation around mental health.</p> <p>“The way the system has been designed, you’re either fit for work or ill,” says Dr Annie Irvine, a lecturer in social policy at the University of York.</p> <p>“The only part of people’s life situation that the welfare system is interested in hearing about and legitimising is the health part,” she adds. “No matter what other issues you’re also dealing with – housing, lone parenthood, domestic violence, relationship breakdown, caring – the only part of that the system has a space for at the moment is the mental distress part.”</p> <p>Irvine is not questioning the legitimacy of people’s mental distress. “This idea of shirkers and scroungers claiming benefits by choice is just not reflected in the research I have done,” she says. However, based on her qualitative research with welfare recipients, she argues that mental health is often not the only significant barrier to employment.</p> <p>“The barriers to work are much broader than that,” she says. “To bring those numbers down, you need to look beyond the medicalised explanation for worklessness.”</p> <p>The government’s green paper, Irvine says, shows some encouraging signs of recognising this bigger picture.</p> <p>Many are concerned, though, that “overdiagnosis” is a politically convenient idea at a time when squeezing benefits spending is a priority and when the more ingrained determinants of mental health are difficult to fix.</p> <p>“Identifying it as an individual crisis of care speaks to a wider political motive,” says Prof Ewen Speed, a medical sociologist at the University of Essex. “It backgrounds a social crisis of inequality. To talk about this as overdiagnosis is a mischaracterisation of the scope of the problem.”</p>","source":"The Guardian","author":""},{"id":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/05/mental-ill-health-is-losing-its-stigma-but-its-still-used-to-blame-victims-of-abuse","title":"Mental ill-health is losing its stigma, but it’s still used to blame victims of abuse","description":"In the latest case of its type, the Met police failed a woman targeted by a predatory officer","imageUrl":"https://media.guim.co.uk/19126b9f17b1051fa3b8b021504a97efb6a398e2/0_40_3500_2100/500.jpg","category":"Mental Health","date":"2025-04-05","content":"<p>A shocking story about the Metropolitan police last week: a woman who was groomed by a predatory officer has at last <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyd9g2pnwxo\">received&nbsp;an apology</a> after the force spread false information about her mental health rather than investigate him.</p> <p>Lorraine – not her real name – had first complained about PC Phil Hunter after he made a welfare visit to her home. Over a period of two years, he sent her inappropriate messages and tried to isolate her from friends and family as part of a “predatory” plan to have a sexual relationship with her.</p> <p>There followed seven years of failings, in which further complaints were ignored, the Met told external agencies she was making up her claims, and a senior officer attempted to contact her GP, informing social services that he thought she had mental health problems. A letter from the directorate of professional standards now concedes decisions may have been influenced by these beliefs, which had “no basis in fact”.</p> <p>“Surely predators are more drawn to vulnerable people with mental health issues,” Lorraine told the BBC. “Surely they would investigate that more, not less, had it been true?”</p> <p>Criticism has rightly focused on the Met and the way they deal with victims of rogue officers. But there is also a wider pattern here. Although mental health stigma is broadly declining, there are pockets in which it still runs rampant. This is perhaps no better illustrated by the way diagnoses are weaponised against victims of abuse.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People with severe mental health problems are particularly vulnerable to abuse in the first place</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That can happen at scale. It recently emerged that hundreds of female members of the armed forces who accused their colleagues of rape were misdiagnosed with personality disorders – a difficult-to-treat pattern of maladaptive behaviour – that meant they would be no longer able to serve. When seeking help for sexual assault from heath professionals within the military, they had been <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/01/14/female-soldiers-raped-colleagues-misdiagnosed-personality-disorder/\">in effect “written off”</a>: slapped with a stigmatised label and then medically discharged.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.saluteher.co.uk/\">charity Salute Her UK, </a>which supports veterans struggling to adjust to civilian life, some 133 of the 393 female referrals they received in a year had been diagnosed with a personality disorder. This echoes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2012/oct/29/rape-military-shocking-truth\">an earlier US scandal</a>, reported in 2012, whereby rape victims in the Marine Corps and other branches of the armed forces said they were being discharged with these diagnoses. As they are pre-existing conditions, the military is not obliged to pay disability benefits.</p> <p>Then, too, there is a long history of the courts using the mental health records and counselling notes of crime victims to attack their credibility – although recent legislation has made this harder.</p> <p>This lingering pattern has severe consequences. Framing a victim as mentally ill shifts the focus away from the abuse, placing the onus on their disordered mind rather than the perpetrator of the crimes, who can more easily convince others that the victim is delusional.</p> <p>Agencies and the justice system may disbelieve or ignore their testimony; meanwhile, their trauma is never validated, causing further distress. There may be unnecessary medication, and their medical history is for ever altered, which might mean changes to insurance, and barriers to employment.</p> <p>This is compounded by the fact that people with severe mental health problems are particularly vulnerable to abuse in the first place: they are five times more likely to be a victim of assault, three times more likely to be a victim of household crime, and four times as likely to be preyed upon by relatives or acquaintances than the general population. Trauma can also trigger and exacerbate mental health conditions. Aware of the stigma, those suffering from these disorders are <a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/media-a/4121/at-risk-yet-dismissed-report.pdf\">less likely</a> to report crimes.</p> <p>Where to start with addressing the issue? Part of it must involve a reassessment of the use of personality disorder diagnoses when treating victims of trauma. Psychiatrists are divided on whether these definitions help or harm. Borderline personality disorder is seen by some clinicians as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/may/12/is-this-actually-ptsd-clinicians-divided-over-redefining-borderline-personality-disorder\">sexist and stigmatising label</a> that can get in the way of treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, which some believe is often the true cause of symptoms.</p> <p>But there is a broader issue here. Despite a plethora of mental health campaigns that seek to reduce stigma, and raise awareness, discrimination is still very hard to shift in places.</p> <p>Mental health campaigns have for the past two decades often focused on normalising conditions such as anxiety and depression – encouraging people to talk about their feelings and get help if they need it. They often do so by making these problems relatable: after all, everyone has experienced feeling anxious or low.</p> <p>This has been a great success: the taboo over seeking help has significantly decreased. The Time to Change campaign that ran from 2007 to 2021 was shown to have <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(14)70243-3/fulltext\">reached its aims</a> of decreasing stigma. In the largest recent survey, three quarters of Britons say we need to adopt a <a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/policy-institute/research-analysis/attitudes-to-mental-health#:~:text=A%20majority%20in%20all%20countries,is%20a%20sign%20of%20strength\">more tolerant attitude</a> to mental health, and 68% say seeing a mental health professional is a sign of strength.</p> <p>Yet amid all this, vulnerable people are being squeezed out of the picture. As more are “made aware” of possible mental health issues at the milder end of the scale, resources are diverted away from the smaller number who really need them. There is evidence that stigma against severe conditions like schizophrenia is not shifting, even as sufferers from depression become more widely accepted. <a href=\"https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/138029537/Improvement_for_most_but_HILDERSLEY_Acc4Oct2020Epub5Nov2020_GOLD_VoR_CC_BY_.pdf\">Media coverage</a> of psychosis still tends to associate it with violence.</p> <p>Is it time for a more targeted approach to mental health stigma? The public are more aware of loneliness, anxiety, depression and body image issues, and Britain is kinder for it. But we also need to root out discrimination in workplaces, in the justice system, the armed forces and the police, and against those with more severe conditions.

Good psychotherapy, with a well-trained therapist, can change lives for the better.

Thankfully, some psychological professions, including practitioner psychologists and art therapists, are statutorily regulated with protected titles.</p> <p>No one can describe themselves as an art therapist, art psychotherapist, music therapist or drama therapist unless registered with the Health and Care Professions Council. Registration can only be achieved following successful completion of a recognised master’s level degree or master’s level apprenticeship.</p> <p>Voluntary accredited regulation for other modalities, through the Professional Standards Authority, has increased transparency and offers some protection. Anyone looking for therapy should ensure the person claiming to be a psychological practitioner is on one of the accredited registers, or for increased reassurance, registered with the Health and Care Professions Council. <br><strong>Gary Fereday</strong>, Chief Executive<br>British Association of Art Therapists, London</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"8e57b162-2a14-48b1-bafc-8616dabee78e\" data-type=\"subhead\">Teachers are ‘Uberised’ </h2> <p>Teaching, and especially teaching languages online, is commodified to such an extent that even the so-called gold standard, jewel in the crown British Council is not immune (“<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/15/british-council-teachers-gig-economy-tutors-exploiting\"> ‘Exploited teachers forced into work feeding frenzy’ by British Council</a>”, News).</p> <p>Uberfication is the right word for it.

Speaking to broadcasters, Streeting was repeatedly challenged on whether ministers were leaving disabled people uninformed for too long about the plans – and whether they would freeze the personal independence payment (Pip) as part of their welfare package this week.</p> <p>Streeting did not deny the government had dropped plans to freeze Pip after a major backlash from Labour MPs this week. There are still expected to be significant changes to Pip including making the disability payment – which is not dependent on work – harder to claim, as well as changes to employment support for those too sick or disabled to work.</p> <p>Asked whether he thought overdiagnosis of some conditions was a problem, he told BBC One’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg: “I want to follow the evidence and I agree with that point about overdiagnosis.</p> <p>“Here’s the other thing: mental wellbeing, illness, it’s a spectrum and I think definitely there’s an overdiagnosis, but there’s too many people being written off and, to your point about treatment, too many people who just aren’t getting the support they need. So if you can get that support to people much earlier, then you can help people to either stay in work or get back to work.”</p> <p>Minesh Patel, the associate director of policy and campaigns at the charity Mind, said Streeting was right to say that not enough people were getting support, and advised against stigmatising those with mental health problems.</p> <p>He said: “Applying for benefits is not an easy process. People with a mental health problem must go through a lengthy and arduous assessment process, with decisions to not award support often overturned at appeal stage. We must also be extremely careful with the language around mental health diagnoses, which risks creating a climate of stigmatising people’s real experiences and undermining the opinions of medical professionals.”</p> <p>Robert Howard, a professor of old age psychiatry at University College London, said “punishing” people would not get them back to work.</p> <p>He said: “I’m really anxious that the kind of language that Wes Streeting was using this morning will be used to justify further disinvestment in mental health services.</p> <p>“If we want to get people with mental illness back to work, the way to do that is to make sure they can access timely and effective treatment, and pretending that they haven’t got a real illness, it just doesn’t make me feel encouraged that the government will invest sufficiently in mental health services to help people get back.</p> <p>“There’s so many young people with kind of chronic generalised anxiety who can’t work. The way to get them back to work isn’t to kind of shame them and punish them and tell them they’re not ill. The way to get them back to work is to make sure that they have access to proper psychological therapy and treatment so they can be fit and go back to work.”</p> <p>The Guardian reported on Friday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/14/mps-warn-no-10-frontbenchers-could-quit-over-disability-benefits-plan\">that ministers had threatened to resign</a> over any potential freeze to Pip, which would require a vote in parliament. But there remains widespread concern from Labour MPs about how tight the criteria to claim the disability payment will be, and about the changes to employment and support allowance, which covers those who cannot work.</p> <p>“I haven’t seen the full plans, they haven’t come to cabinet yet,” Streeting said. “But what I do know is the work and pensions secretary wants to support people who need help the most and we’ve got to make sure that there is a wider range of support, and that everyone’s playing their part, including me, because with those levels of illness, for example, if I can help people back to health, in many cases I’ll be helping them back to work and that’s what we’ll do.</p> <p>“I haven’t seen the proposals but you’ve seen the briefing, you’ve seen the speculation, I think the moral of the story is wait for the plans.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related:</span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/16/labour-contract-citizen-state-keir-starmer\">It is mission critical that Labour repairs the contract between citizen and state | Andrew Rawnsley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Streeting said he did not come into politics to take money from the most vulnerable in society but that there was still a need for reform. “We want to support people who are the poorest and most vulnerable to make sure they’ve got dignity, independence and great quality of life,” he said.</p> <p>“Without that support from an active state, I wouldn’t be here talking to you. The challenge we’ve got [is] we’ve got one in eight young people in this country not in education, employment or in training. We’ve got one in 10 people who are off work, sick, and 3 million people shut out of the labour market because of long-term illness.</p> <p>“Now, of course, there will be some people because of serious disability or because of chronic illness that can’t be turned around, will not be able to work, and those people need to be supported. But the welfare state’s also got to be a springboard back to work and lots of people get written off, you know, as if they can’t contribute when they can and should and want to.”</p> <p><em>• Join Wes Streeting in conversation with Pippa Crerar discussing England’s health and social care system and how Labour plans to turn it around.
