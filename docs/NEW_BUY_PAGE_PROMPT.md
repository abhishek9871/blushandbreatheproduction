# Starter Prompt for New Buy Page Implementation

Copy and paste this prompt when starting a new chat thread:

---

```
I want to implement a new high-converting buy page at `/buy/[slug]`.

**BEFORE DOING ANYTHING:**
1. Read `docs/BUY_PAGE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` completely
2. Read `docs/BUY_PAGE_CHECKLIST.md` completely

These files contain:
- Exact workflow to follow
- Research prompts to use
- Data structure requirements
- Schema markup rules (CRITICAL - avoid past mistakes)
- UI/UX testing requirements
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them

**After reading both files, ask me:**
1. What substance/product should we target?
2. Do I have any existing research, or should we start fresh?

Then follow the guide step-by-step:
1. Research Phase (keywords, citations, alternatives)
2. Data Entry (buy-pages.json)
3. Build & Test (mobile, dark mode)
4. Rich Results Validation
5. Deploy & Index

Reference: This workflow was perfected during the Buy DMAA India page implementation.
