1. Article links now navigate to a populated detail page.------------I have a feeling that the articles, although I can see some content, but I think the content seems truncated. I have attached a screenshot regarding this and the truncated stuff which I see I have marked in red marker. So please look into it and make sure the whole content for all the articles is visible so that it is engaging as well. Thank you.

2.Beauty sorting visibly updates the product list.------I observe no change in the behaviour.

3. Bookmark toggling shows immediate, clear visual confirmation.--------Visual confirmation is there, but not visible in bookmark page.

4. Nutrition cards render correctly with numeric values.-------I still see no content.

5. Products are sourced from a real API; cards are clickable and open a working product detail page.-------I see no change, just mock products and they are not clickable.

6. Footer links navigate properly without scrolling to the top.-------They do navigate to their respective page, but there are no dedicated pages for these and the content on these pages are just too bland.

7. On the videos page, clicking on a video just navigates me to the homepage.

8. I observed that earlier before this change, this fix that was made on the beauty page, there were bookmark options on the products, but those seem to be removed and have been changed to the articles. I mean, this is also fine, but we need to add bookmark to the original place as well, so this has to be fixed as well.


9. The Join Our Newsletter component on the page seems to be behaving abnormally as there is an option to enter the email but we can't enter our email. But when we click on the subscribe button and then a model opens and we can enter the email and click on subscribe and it happens but I don't know is the real subscribing happening or not. Because it's not so we need to work on it and make sure this works. This behavior needs to be checked and there should be one thing that we should be focusing on. Either we focus on the main thing like entering our email on the page itself without the model or we should keep the model. This needs to be decided by you. So this is my observation.
