Natural steroids may enhance this by providing amino acid building blocks and signaling muscle cells to increase protein production.</p><h3>Improved Nitrogen Retention</h3><p>Muscles are approximately 16% nitrogen. A positive nitrogen balance indicates an anabolic (muscle-building) state.</p><h3>Accelerated Recovery</h3><p>Faster recovery means more frequent training and faster progress.

Reduced Serotonin & Cortisol</h3><p>By modulating serotonin levels during training, D-Bal Max may help delay fatigue, allowing for longer, more intense workouts. Lower cortisol also means less muscle breakdown.</p><h3>3.
