trade names <b>Forthane</b> and <b>Geranamine</b>) is an indirect sympathomimetic drug invented and developed by Eli Lilly and Company and marketed as an inhaled nasal decongestant from 1948 until it was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in the 1980s. </p><p>Since 2006 methylhexanamine has been sold extensively under many names as a stimulant or energy-boosting dietary supplement under the claim that it is similar to certain compounds found in geraniums, but its safety has been questioned as a number of adverse events and at least five deaths have been associated with methylhexanamine-containing supplements. It is banned by many sports authorities and governmental agencies. Despite multiple warning letters from the FDA, as of 2019, the stimulant remains available in sports and weight loss supplements in the US. </p> <meta property=\"mw:PageProp/toc\"> <p>In April 1944, Eli Lilly and Company introduced methylhexanamine under the brand name Forthane as an inhaled nasal decongestant; Lilly voluntarily withdrew methylhexanamine from the market in 1983. The compound is an aliphatic amine; the pharmaceutical industry had a strong interest in compounds in this class as nasal decongestants in the early 20th century, which led to methylhexanamine and four other similar compounds being brought to market for that use: tuaminoheptane, octin (isometheptene), oenethyl (2-methylaminoheptane), and propylhexedrine; octin and oenethyl were eventually approved for use in keeping blood pressure sufficiently high for patients under anesthesia. </p> <div><h2 >Marketing as dietary supplement</h2><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Methylhexanamine&action=edit&section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Marketing as dietary supplement\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Patrick Arnold reintroduced methylhexanamine in 2006 as a dietary supplement, after the final ban of ephedrine in the United States in 2005. Arnold introduced it under the trademarked name Geranamine, a name held by his company, Proviant Technologies. A large number of supplements focusing on fat loss and workout energy (thermogenic or general-purpose stimulants) used the ingredient in concert with other substances such as caffeine, a combination similar to the combination of ephedrine and caffeine. </p><p>Methylhexanamine-containing supplements sometimes list \"geranium oil\" or \"geranium extract\" as a source of methylhexanamine. However, geranium oils do not contain methylhexanamine, and the methylhexanamine in these supplements is added in the form of synthetic material. A variety of studies have explored the possibility that DMAA is found in some types of geraniums, but at present, high quality evidence of DMAA's presence in plants is lacking. </p><p>Methylhexanamine is synthesized by reacting 4-methylhexan-2-one with hydroxylamine, which converts the 4-methylhexan-2-one to 4-methylhexan-2-one oxime, which is reduced via catalytic hydrogenation; the resulting methylhexanamine can be purified by distillation. </p> <p>Methylhexanamine is an indirect sympathomimetic drug that constricts blood vessels and thus has effects on the heart, lungs, and reproductive organs. It also causes bronchodilation, inhibits peristalsis in the intestines, and has diuretic effects. </p><p>Most studies have been done on pharmacological effects when the drug is inhaled; the understanding of what methylhexanamine does when taken orally are mostly based on extrapolating from the activities of similar compounds. A 2013 review concluded that: \"Pharmacological effects after oral intake can be expected on the lungs (bronchodilation) and the nasal mucosa following a single oral dose of about 4–15&#160;mg. Pharmacological effects on the heart can be expected following a single oral dose of about 50–75&#160;mg. Pharmacological effects on the blood pressure can be expected after a single oral dose of about 100&#160;mg. Because of the long half-life, there is a risk that repeated doses within 24–36 hours could lead to steadily stronger pharmacological effects (build-up).\" </p><p>In 2019 and 2023, methylhexanamine was found to show activity consistent with being a norepinephrine and dopamine releasing agent (NDRA). </p> <div><h3 >Detection in body fluids</h3><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Methylhexanamine&action=edit&section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Detection in body fluids\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Methylhexanamine may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine by gas or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma methylhexanamine concentrations are expected to be in a range of 10–100 μg/L in persons using the drug recreationally, &gt;100 μg/L in intoxicated patients, and &gt;300 μg/L in victims of acute overdosage. </p> <p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Median_lethal_dose\" title=\"Median lethal dose\">LD<sub>50</sub></a> for methylhexanamine is 39&#160;mg/kg in mice and 72.5&#160;mg/kg in rats, when administered intravenously. </p><p>The FDA has stated that methylhexanamine \"is known to narrow the blood vessels and arteries, which can elevate blood pressure and may lead to cardiovascular events ranging from shortness of breath and tightening in the chest to heart attack\". Numerous adverse events and at least five deaths have been reported in association with methylhexanamine-containing dietary supplements. There have also been reports of secondary open-angle glaucoma related to methylhexanamine supplementation. </p><p>A 2012 review by a panel convened by the U.S. Department of Defense to study whether the military should ban methylhexanamine supplements from stores on its bases concluded that: \"The existing evidence does not conclusively establish that DMAA-containing substances are causally-associated with adverse medical events. However, a consistent theme among the studies is that DMAA use potentially affects cardiovascular function, just as other sympathomimetic stimulants. Without further rigorous study designs developed to evaluate the safety of DMAA, especially in patients with concomitant use of other substances, co-morbid conditions and high frequency use, the magnitude of the association of DMAA with adverse medical events is uncertain. Widespread use of DMAA-containing products by tens of thousands of Service members – often in combination with other substances – increases the likelihood of observing serious adverse events, even if the overall risk of a DMAA-related event is low, resulting in consequential impact to some Service members and other beneficiaries. DMAA should be further studied to evaluate its safety. Data from the case control study suggest that the frequency and amount of DMAA use and risk of specific [acquired medical events], particularly heat injuries and rhabdomyolysis, need to be examined in greater detail. ... The Safety Review Panel recommended ... to continue the prohibition of sales of DMAA-containing products in Exchanges and concessions. The Panel judged that the evidence supports sufficient risk, even if very low, of another death or catastrophic illness of a Service member who has used DMAA-containing products, without any offsetting benefit of these products.\" </p> <div><h3 >Deaths and injuries</h3><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Methylhexanamine&action=edit&section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Deaths and injuries\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>In 2010, a 21-year-old man in New Zealand presented with a cerebral hemorrhage after ingesting 556&#160;mg of methylhexanamine, caffeine, and alcohol. Health authorities in Hawaii linked cases of liver failure and one death to OxyElite Pro, a weight loss and bodybuilding dietary supplement. </p><p>The death of Claire Squires, a runner who collapsed near the finish-line of the April 2012 London Marathon, has been linked to methylhexanamine. The coroner stated that methylhexanamine was \"probably an important factor\" during the inquest. Despite, according to a friend, having been diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat and advised not to consume methylhexanamine, it is believed that she consumed the substance through drinking an energy drink, which was subsequently reformulated to exclude methylhexanamine. </p> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Amphetamine_vs_methylhexaneamine.png\"><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Amphetamine_vs_methylhexaneamine.png/330px-Amphetamine_vs_methylhexaneamine.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"265\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Amphetamine_vs_methylhexaneamine.png/500px-Amphetamine_vs_methylhexaneamine.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Amphetamine_vs_methylhexaneamine.png/960px-Amphetamine_vs_methylhexaneamine.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"1100\" data-file-height=\"940\"></a><figcaption>Chemical structures of amphetamine and methylhexanamine compared.</figcaption></figure> <p>Methylhexanamine, also known as 1,3-dimethylamylamine (1,3-DMAA), is an alkylamine. </p><p>It is closely structurally related to other alkylamines, including 1,3-dimethylbutylamine (1,3-DMBA), 1,4-dimethylamylamine (1,4-DMAA), heptaminol (2-methyl-6-amino-2-heptanol), iproheptine (<i>N</i>-isopropyl-1,5-dimethylhexylamine), isometheptene (2-methyl-6-methylamino-2-heptene), octodrine (2-amino-6-methylheptane or 1,5-dimethylhexylamine), and tuaminoheptane (tuamine; 2-aminoheptane or 1-methylhexylamine). </p><p>Methylhexanamine and other related alkylamines are similar in chemical structure to phenethylamines and amphetamines, but lack a closed ring. </p><p>The predicted log P (XLogP3) of methylhexanamine is 1.9. </p> <p>A number of sporting authorities and countries have banned or heavily restricted the use of methylhexanamine as a dietary supplement, due to serious concerns about its safety.

Despite multiple warning letters from the [FDA](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration),[[11]](#cite_note-12) as of 2019, the [stimulant](/wiki/Stimulant) remains available in sports and weight loss supplements in the [US](/wiki/United_States).[[12]](#cite_note-13)\n\nIn April 1944, [Eli Lilly and Company](/wiki/Eli_Lilly_and_Company) introduced methylhexanamine under the brand name Forthane as an inhaled [nasal decongestant](/wiki/Nasal_decongestant); Lilly voluntarily withdrew methylhexanamine from the market in 1983.[[13]](#cite_note-DODTox-14): 12  The compound is an [aliphatic](/wiki/Aliphatic) [amine](/wiki/Amine); the pharmaceutical industry had a strong interest in compounds in this class as nasal decongestants in the early 20th century, which led to methylhexanamine and four other similar compounds being brought to market for that use: [tuaminoheptane](/wiki/Tuaminoheptane), [octin (isometheptene)](/wiki/Isometheptene), [oenethyl](/wiki/Oenethyl) (2-methylaminoheptane), and [propylhexedrine](/wiki/Propylhexedrine); octin and oenethyl were eventually approved for use in keeping blood pressure sufficiently high for patients under [anesthesia](/wiki/Anesthesia).[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]: 95–96 \n\n## Marketing as dietary supplement\n\n[Patrick Arnold](/wiki/Patrick_Arnold) reintroduced methylhexanamine in 2006 as a [dietary supplement](/wiki/Dietary_supplement),[[14]](#cite_note-15)[[15]](#cite_note-16) after the final ban of [ephedrine](/wiki/Ephedrine) in the United States in 2005. Arnold introduced it under the trademarked name Geranamine, a name held by his company, Proviant Technologies. A large number of supplements focusing on fat loss and workout energy ([thermogenic](/wiki/Thermogenic) or general-purpose [stimulants](/wiki/Stimulant)) used the ingredient in concert with other substances such as [caffeine](/wiki/Caffeine), a combination similar to the combination of [ephedrine and caffeine](/wiki/ECA_stack).\nMethylhexanamine-containing supplements sometimes list \"geranium oil\" or \"geranium extract\" as a source of methylhexanamine. However, geranium oils do not contain methylhexanamine, and the methylhexanamine in these supplements is added in the form of synthetic material.[[16]](#cite_note-17) A variety of studies have explored the possibility that DMAA is found in some types of geraniums, but at present, high quality evidence of DMAA's presence in plants is lacking.[[17]](#cite_note-18)[[18]](#cite_note-19)\nMethylhexanamine is [synthesized](/wiki/Chemical_synthesis) by [reacting](/wiki/Chemical_reaction) 4-methylhexan-2-one with hydroxylamine, which converts the 4-methylhexan-2-one to 4-methylhexan-2-one oxime, which is [reduced](/wiki/Organic_redox_reaction#Organic_reductions) via [catalytic hydrogenation](/wiki/Catalytic_hydrogenation); the resulting methylhexanamine can be purified by distillation.[[19]](#cite_note-20): 995–996 \n\nMethylhexanamine is an indirect [sympathomimetic drug](/wiki/Sympathomimetic_drug) that [constricts blood vessels](/wiki/Vasoconstriction) and thus has effects on the heart, lungs, and reproductive organs. It also causes [bronchodilation](/wiki/Bronchodilation), inhibits [peristalsis](/wiki/Peristalsis) in the intestines, and has [diuretic](/wiki/Diuretic) effects.\nMost studies have been done on pharmacological effects when the drug is inhaled; the understanding of what methylhexanamine does when taken orally are mostly based on extrapolating from the activities of similar compounds.: 97  A 2013 review concluded that: \"Pharmacological effects after oral intake can be expected on the lungs (bronchodilation) and the nasal mucosa following a single oral dose of about 4–15&#160;mg. Pharmacological effects on the heart can be expected following a single oral dose of about 50–75&#160;mg. Pharmacological effects on the blood pressure can be expected after a single oral dose of about 100&#160;mg. Because of the long half-life, there is a risk that repeated doses within 24–36 hours could lead to steadily stronger pharmacological effects (build-up).\": 98 \nIn 2019 and 2023, methylhexanamine was found to show activity consistent with being a [norepinephrine and dopamine releasing agent](/wiki/Norepinephrine%E2%80%93dopamine_releasing_agent) (NDRA).[[20]](#cite_note-SmallChengBelay2023-21)[[21]](#cite_note-DochertyAlsufyani2021-22)[[22]](#cite_note-AlsufyaniDocherty2019-23)\n\n### Detection in body fluids\n\nMethylhexanamine may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine by gas or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma methylhexanamine concentrations are expected to be in a range of 10–100 μg/L in persons using the drug recreationally, >100 μg/L in intoxicated patients, and >300 μg/L in victims of acute overdosage.[[23]](#cite_note-24)[[24]](#cite_note-25)\n\nThe [LD50](/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) for methylhexanamine is 39&#160;mg/kg in mice and 72.5&#160;mg/kg in rats, when administered intravenously.: 95 [[25]](#cite_note-26): 110 \nThe FDA has stated that methylhexanamine \"is known to narrow the blood vessels and arteries, which can elevate blood pressure and may lead to cardiovascular events ranging from shortness of breath and tightening in the chest to heart attack\".[[26]](#cite_note-FDA42712-27) Numerous adverse events and at least five deaths have been reported in association with methylhexanamine-containing dietary supplements.[[10]](#cite_note-nyt-fda-11) There have also been reports of secondary open-angle [glaucoma](/wiki/Glaucoma) related to methylhexanamine supplementation.[[27]](#cite_note-28)\nA 2012 review by a panel convened by the U.S. Department of Defense to study whether the military should ban methylhexanamine supplements from stores on its bases concluded that: \"The existing evidence does not conclusively establish that DMAA-containing substances are causally-associated with adverse medical events. However, a consistent theme among the studies is that DMAA use potentially affects cardiovascular function, just as other sympathomimetic stimulants. Without further rigorous study designs developed to evaluate the safety of DMAA, especially in patients with concomitant use of other substances, co-morbid conditions and high frequency use, the magnitude of the association of DMAA with adverse medical events is uncertain.  Widespread use of DMAA-containing products by tens of thousands of Service members – often in combination with other substances – increases the likelihood of observing serious adverse events, even if the overall risk of a DMAA-related event is low, resulting in consequential impact to some Service members and other beneficiaries. DMAA should be further studied to evaluate its safety. Data from the case control study suggest that the frequency and amount of DMAA use and risk of specific [acquired medical events], particularly heat injuries and rhabdomyolysis, need to be examined in greater detail. ... The Safety Review Panel recommended ... to continue the prohibition of sales of DMAA-containing products in Exchanges and concessions.

          "abstract": "In June 2012 DMAA (1,3-dimethylamylamine), an ephedrine-like vasoconstricting substance which had been included in many popular sports supplements, became a scheduled substance in Australia, following bans in several other countries. The underlying rationale for this ban was that DMAA use is unsafe. This paper aimed to critically review the available evidence on the acute and/or long-term harms of DMAA. Using five research databases (PubMed, Embase, ProQuest Health and Medical Complete, and Web of Science) and the key terms 'methylhexaneamine', 'DMAA', 'dimethylamylamine', '1,3-dimethylpentylamine' and '2-amino-4-methylhexane', 842 articles were identified once duplicates removed. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Of the included studies, eight were case studies, which reported on eight patients who presented to emergence departments. All were retrospective in their reporting. The patients displayed various outcomes; while the patients were presenting with serious problems, in most patients conditions subsided on cessation of supplement use. The remaining eight experimental studies were low powered, with a number of studies conducted by a single research group with industry ties, and broadly investigated the effects of DMAA on physiological outcomes. Mixed findings were apparent, although escalations of blood pressure were present on acute dosing, as well as decreases in measures of body weight and body fat. There is a shallow evidence base describing the adverse effects of DMAA and the dose above which such effects may occur. The scheduling of DMAA in many countries may now impede research efforts to determine whether there are safe doses at which DMAA can be consumed.",

It is usually taken orally (swallowed by mouth), but may be given intravenously. </p><p>Side effects of phenibut can include sedation, sleepiness, nausea, irritability, agitation, dizziness, euphoria, and sometimes headache, among others. Overdose of phenibut can produce marked central nervous system depression including unconsciousness. The medication is structurally related to the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and hence is a GABA analogue. Phenibut is thought to act as a <a href=\"/wiki/GABAB_receptor\" title=\"GABAB receptor\">GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor</a> agonist, similarly to baclofen and γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). However, at low concentrations, phenibut mildly increases the concentration of dopamine in the brain, providing stimulatory effects in addition to the anxiolysis. </p><p>Phenibut was developed in the Soviet Union and was introduced for medical use in the 1960s. Today, it is marketed for medical use in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Latvia. The medication is not approved for clinical use in the United States and most of Europe, but it is sold on the Internet as a supplement and purported nootropic. Phenibut has been used recreationally and can produce euphoria as well as addiction, dependence, and withdrawal. It is a controlled substance in Australia, and it has been suggested that its legal status should be reconsidered in Europe as well. In Germany, phenibut is not approved as a drug and, as a food supplement, is controlled under the German New Psychoactive Substances Act. </p><p>In a 2023 assessment, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that phenibut does not meet the definition of a dietary ingredient, thereby making phenibut supplement products misbranded and illegal for marketing. FDA warning letters had been issued to supplement manufacturers marketing phenibut products as adulterated. </p> <meta property=\"mw:PageProp/toc\"> <p>Phenibut is used in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Latvia as a pharmaceutical drug to treat anxiety and to improve sleep (e.g., in the treatment of insomnia). It is also used for various other indications, including the treatment of asthenia, depression, alcoholism, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, stuttering, tics, vestibular disorders, Ménière's disease, dizziness, for the prevention of motion sickness, and for the prevention of anxiety before or after surgical procedures or painful diagnostic tests. </p> <p>Phenibut is available as a medication in the form of 250&#160;mg or 500&#160;mg tablets for oral administration and as a solution at a concentration of 10&#160;mg/mL for infusion. In the US, dietary supplements labeled as containing phenibut have been found to contain zero to greater than 1,100&#160;mg of phenibut per serving. </p> <p>Contraindications of phenibut include: </p> <ul><li>Intolerance to phenibut</li> <li>Pregnancy and breastfeeding</li> <li>Children who are younger than two years of age</li> <li>Liver insufficiency or failure</li> <li>Ulcerative lesions of the gastrointestinal tract</li></ul> <p>Phenibut should not be combined with alcohol. </p> <p>Phenibut is generally well-tolerated. Possible side effects may include sedation, somnolence, nausea, irritability, agitation, anxiety, dizziness, headache, and allergic reactions such as skin rash and itching. At high doses, motor incoordination, loss of balance, and hangovers may occur. Due to its CNS depressant effects, people taking phenibut should refrain from potentially dangerous activities such as operating heavy machinery. With prolonged use of phenibut, particularly at high doses, the liver and blood should be monitored, due to risk of fatty liver disease and eosinophilia. </p> <div><h3 >Dependence and withdrawal</h3><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Phenibut&action=edit&section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Dependence and withdrawal\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Tolerance to phenibut easily develops with repeated use, leading to dependence. Withdrawal symptoms may occur upon discontinuation, and, in recreational users taking high doses, have been reported to include severe rebound anxiety, insomnia, aggresion, irritability, agitation, visual and auditory hallucinations, and acute psychosis. Baclofen has successfully been used for treatment of phenibut dependence. </p> <p>In overdose, phenibut can cause severe drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, eosinophilia, lowered blood pressure, renal impairment, and, above 7&#160;grams, fatty liver degeneration. There are no specific antidotes for phenibut overdose. Lethargy, somnolence, agitation, delirium, tonic–clonic seizures, reduced consciousness or unconsciousness, and unresponsiveness have been reported in recreational users who have overdosed. Management of phenibut overdose includes activated charcoal, gastric lavage, induction of vomiting, and symptom-based treatment. There have been three associated deaths which found Phenibut in the users system but only one of these cases solely included Phenibut. </p> <p>Phenibut may mutually potentiate and extend the duration of the effects of other CNS depressants, including anxiolytics, antipsychotics, sedatives, opioids, anticonvulsants, and alcohol. </p> <table> <caption>GABA and analogues<br>at biological targets </caption> <tbody><tr> <th>Compound</th> <th><a href=\"/wiki/GABAB_receptor\" title=\"GABAB receptor\">GABA<sub>B</sub></a></th> <th><a href=\"/wiki/GABAA_receptor\" title=\"GABAA receptor\">GABA<sub>A</sub></a> </th></tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"/wiki/%CE%93-Aminobutyric_acid\" title=\"Γ-Aminobutyric acid\"><abbr title=\"γ-Aminobutyric acid\">GABA</abbr></a>Tooltip γ-Aminobutyric acid</td> <td>0.08</td> <td>0.12 </td></tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"/wiki/%CE%93-Hydroxybutyric_acid\" title=\"Γ-Hydroxybutyric acid\"><abbr title=\"γ-Hydroxybutyric acid\">GHB</abbr></a>Tooltip γ-Hydroxybutyric acid</td> <td>&gt;100</td> <td>&gt;100 </td></tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"/wiki/%CE%93-Amino-%CE%B2-hydroxybutyric_acid\" title=\"Γ-Amino-β-hydroxybutyric acid\"><abbr title=\"γ-Amino-β-hydroxybutyric acid\">GABOB</abbr></a>Tooltip γ-Amino-β-hydroxybutyric acid</td> <td>1.10</td> <td>1.38 </td></tr> <tr> <td>Phenibut</td> <td>9.6</td> <td>&gt;100 </td></tr> <tr> <td>4-F-phenibut</td> <td>1.70</td> <td>&gt;100 </td></tr> <tr> <td>Baclofen</td> <td>0.13</td> <td>&gt;100 </td></tr> <tr> <td>&#160;&#160;<a href=\"/wiki/Baclofen\" title=\"Baclofen\">(<i>R</i>)-Baclofen</a></td> <td>0.13</td> <td>&gt;100 </td></tr> <tr> <td>&#160;&#160;<a href=\"/wiki/Baclofen\" title=\"Baclofen\">(<i>S</i>)-Baclofen</a></td> <td>74.0</td> <td>&gt;100 </td></tr> <tr> <td colspan=\"3\">Values are <a href=\"/wiki/IC50\" title=\"IC50\">IC<sub>50</sub></a> (μM) in rat brain. </td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Phenibut acts as a full agonist of the <a href=\"/wiki/GABAB_receptor\" title=\"GABAB receptor\">GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor</a>, similarly to baclofen.

Both (<i>R</i>)-phenibut and (<i>S</i>)-phenibut display this action with similar affinity (K<sub>i</sub> = 23 and 39&#160;μM, respectively). </p><p>It is often claimed on websites about nootropics and elsewhere on the internet that phenibut increases dopamine. Three papers published in Russian by Soviet scientists in 1979, 1986, and 1990 report that phenibut increases dopamine in the striatum of rats and in the mouse brain. The mechanism underlying this putative effect is unclear. Structurally, phenibut can also be considered a derivative of phenethylamine, and some research suggests that phenibut antagonizes the action of phenethylamine. </p> <p>Little information thus far has been published on the clinical pharmacokinetics of phenibut. The drug is reported to be well-absorbed. It distributes widely throughout the body and across the blood–brain barrier. Approximately 0.1% of an administered dose of phenibut reportedly penetrates into the brain, with this said to occur to a much greater extent in young people and the elderly. Following a single 250&#160;mg dose in healthy volunteers, its elimination half-life was approximately 5.3&#160;hours and the drug was largely (63%) excreted in the urine unchanged. </p><p>Some limited information has been described on the pharmacokinetics of phenibut in recreational users taking much higher doses (e.g., 1–3&#160;grams) than typical clinical doses. In these individuals, the onset of action of phenibut has been reported to be 2 to 4&#160;hours orally and 20 to 30&#160;minutes rectally, the peak effects are described as occurring 4 to 6&#160;hours following oral ingestion, and the total duration for the oral route has been reported to be 15 to 24&#160;hours (or about 3 to 5 terminal half-lives). </p> <p>Phenibut is a synthetic aromatic amino acid. It is a chiral molecule and thus has two potential configurations, as (<i>R</i>)- and (<i>S</i>)-enantiomers. </p> <div><h3 >Structure and analogues</h3><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Phenibut&action=edit&section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Structure and analogues\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Phenibut_and_analogues.png\"><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Phenibut_and_analogues.png/500px-Phenibut_and_analogues.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"350\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Phenibut_and_analogues.png/960px-Phenibut_and_analogues.png 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"3200\" data-file-height=\"3000\"></a><figcaption>Chemical structures of phenibut and analogues.</figcaption></figure> <p>Phenibut is a derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Hence, it is a GABA analogue. Phenibut is specifically the analogue of GABA with a phenyl ring substituted in at the β-position. As such, its chemical name is β-phenyl-γ-aminobutyric acid, which can be abbreviated as β-phenyl-GABA. The presence of the phenyl ring allows phenibut to cross the blood–brain barrier significantly, unlike GABA. Phenibut also contains the trace amine β-phenethylamine in its structure. </p><p>Phenibut is closely related to a variety of other GABA analogues including baclofen (β-(4-chlorophenyl)-GABA), 4-fluorophenibut (β-(4-fluorophenyl)-GABA), tolibut (β-(4-methylphenyl)-GABA), pregabalin ((<i>S</i>)-β-isobutyl-GABA), gabapentin (1-(aminomethyl)cyclohexane acetic acid), and GABOB (β-hydroxy-GABA). It has almost the same chemical structure as baclofen, differing from it only in having a hydrogen atom instead of a chlorine atom at the <i>para</i> position of the phenyl ring. Phenibut is also close in structure to pregabalin, which has an isobutyl group at the β position instead of phenibut's phenyl ring. </p><p>A glutamate-derivative analogue of phenibut is glufimet (dimethyl 3-phenylglutamate hydrochloride). </p> <p>A chemical synthesis of phenibut has been published. </p> <p>Phenibut was synthesized at the A. I. Herzen Leningrad Pedagogical Institute (USSR) by Professor Vsevolod Perekalin's team and tested at the Institute of Experimental Medicine, USSR Academy of Medical Sciences. It was introduced into clinical use in Russia in the 1960s. </p> <div><h2 >Society and culture</h2><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Phenibut&action=edit&section=15\" title=\"Edit section: Society and culture\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Phenibut_from_Russia.png\"><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Phenibut_from_Russia.png/250px-Phenibut_from_Russia.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"225\" height=\"106\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Phenibut_from_Russia.png/500px-Phenibut_from_Russia.png 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"922\" data-file-height=\"433\"></a><figcaption>Olainfarm's pharmaceutical phenibut sold in Russia.</figcaption></figure> <p>Alternate spellings include <i>fenibut</i> and <i>phenybut</i>.

The drug has not been assigned an <a href=\"/wiki/International_Nonproprietary_Name\" title=\"International Nonproprietary Name\"><abbr title=\"International Nonproprietary Name\">INN</abbr></a>Tooltip International Nonproprietary Name. </p> <p>Phenibut is marketed in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Latvia under the brand names Anvifen, Fenibut, Bifren, and Noofen (Russian: Анвифен, Фенибут, Бифрен and Ноофен, respectively). </p> <p>Phenibut is approved in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia and Latvia for medical use. It is not approved or available as a medication in other countries in the European Union, the United States, or Australia. In countries where phenibut is not a licensed pharmaceutical drug, it is sold online without a prescription as a \"nutritional supplement\". It is often used as a form of self-medication for social anxiety. </p> <p>Phenibut is used recreationally due to its ability to produce euphoria, anxiolysis, and increased sociability, as well as remaining undetected in routine urinalysis. Because of its delayed onset of effects, first-time users often mistakenly take an additional dose of phenibut in the belief that the initial dose did not work. Recreational users usually take the drug orally; there are a few case reports of rectal administration and one report of insufflation, which was described as \"very painful\" and causing swollen nostrils. </p> <p>As of 2021, phenibut is a controlled substance in Australia, France, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, and Germany where, nevertheless, it is readily obtained online. </p><p>In 2015, it was suggested that the legal status of phenibut in Europe should be reconsidered due to its recreational potential. In February 2018, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration declared it a prohibited (schedule 9) substance, citing health concerns due to withdrawal and overdose. </p><p>As of 14 November 2018, Hungary added phenibut and 10 other items to its New Psychoactive Substances ban list, and, as of 26 August 2020, Italy added phenibut to its New Psychoactive Substances ban list. As of 18 September 2020, France added phenibut to the controlled psychoactive substances list, prohibiting production, sale, storage, and use. </p><p>In the United States, phenibut is an unapproved drug, but is often misleadingly marketed as a dietary supplement. It is readily available without a prescription. </p><p>In Alabama, phenibut was made a Schedule II substance at the state level in November 2021. </p> <ul><li>Gabapentin</li> <li>Pregabalin</li> <li>4-Fluorophenibut</li> <li>List of Russian drugs</li></ul> <div> <ol> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-DrobizhevFedotova2016_1-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-DrobizhevFedotova2016_1-1\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-DrobizhevFedotova2016_1-2\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-DrobizhevFedotova2016_1-3\"></a> <cite >Drobizhev MY, Fedotova AV, Kikta SV, Antohin EY (2016). <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.rmj.ru/articles/nevrologiya/Fenomen_aminofenilmaslyanoy_kisloty/\">\"Феномен аминофенилмасляной кислоты\"</a> [Phenomenon of aminophenylbutyric acid]. <i>Russian Medical Journal</i> (in Russian). <b>2017</b> (24): 1657–1663.

sold under the brand name **Anvifen** among others,[[1]](#cite_note-DrobizhevFedotova2016-1) is a [central nervous system](/wiki/Central_nervous_system) (CNS) [depressant](/wiki/Depressant) with [anxiolytic](/wiki/Anxiolytic) effects, and is used to treat [anxiety](/wiki/Anxiety), [insomnia](/wiki/Insomnia), and for a variety of other indications.[[5]](#cite_note-pmid11830761-5) It is usually taken [orally](/wiki/Oral_administration) (swallowed by mouth), but may be given [intravenously](/wiki/Intravenously).[[6]](#cite_note-Phenibut-Label-6)[[5]](#cite_note-pmid11830761-5)\nSide effects of phenibut can include [sedation](/wiki/Sedation), [sleepiness](/wiki/Sleepiness), [nausea](/wiki/Nausea), [irritability](/wiki/Irritability), [agitation](/wiki/Psychomotor_agitation), [dizziness](/wiki/Dizziness), [euphoria](/wiki/Euphoria), and sometimes [headache](/wiki/Headache), among others.[[6]](#cite_note-Phenibut-Label-6)[[7]](#cite_note-RLS-Phenibut-7) [Overdose](/wiki/Overdose) of phenibut can produce marked central nervous system depression including [unconsciousness](/wiki/Unconsciousness).[[6]](#cite_note-Phenibut-Label-6)[[7]](#cite_note-RLS-Phenibut-7) The medication is structurally related to the [neurotransmitter](/wiki/Neurotransmitter) [γ-aminobutyric acid](/wiki/%CE%93-aminobutyric_acid) (GABA), and hence is a [GABA analogue](/wiki/GABA_analogue).[[5]](#cite_note-pmid11830761-5) Phenibut is thought to act as a [GABAB receptor](/wiki/GABAB_receptor) [agonist](/wiki/Agonist), similarly to [baclofen](/wiki/Baclofen) and [γ-hydroxybutyrate](/wiki/%CE%93-hydroxybutyrate) (GHB).[[5]](#cite_note-pmid11830761-5) However, at low concentrations, phenibut mildly increases the concentration of [dopamine](/wiki/Dopamine) in the brain, providing [stimulatory](/wiki/Stimulant) effects in addition to the [anxiolysis](/wiki/Anxiolytic).[[8]](#cite_note-8)\nPhenibut was developed in the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union) and was introduced for medical use in the 1960s.[[5]](#cite_note-pmid11830761-5) Today, it is marketed for medical use in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Latvia.[[5]](#cite_note-pmid11830761-5) The medication is not approved for clinical use in the United States and most of Europe, but it is sold on the Internet as a [supplement](/wiki/Dietary_supplement) and purported [nootropic](/wiki/Nootropic).[[3]](#cite_note-pmid26693960-3)[[9]](#cite_note-ClinicalTox-9) Phenibut has been used [recreationally](/wiki/Recreational_drug) and can produce [euphoria](/wiki/Euphoria) as well as [addiction](/wiki/Drug_addiction), [dependence](/wiki/Drug_dependence), and [withdrawal](/wiki/Drug_withdrawal).[[3]](#cite_note-pmid26693960-3) It is a [controlled substance](/wiki/Controlled_substance) in Australia, and it has been suggested that its legal status should be reconsidered in Europe as well.[[3]](#cite_note-pmid26693960-3) In Germany, phenibut is not approved as a drug and, as a food supplement, is controlled under the German New Psychoactive Substances Act.[[10]](#cite_note-Anlage_NpSG_-_Einzelnorm-10)\nIn a 2023 assessment, the U.S. [Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) (FDA) determined that phenibut does not meet the definition of a dietary ingredient, thereby making phenibut supplement products misbranded and illegal for marketing.[[11]](#cite_note-fda-23-11) [FDA warning letters](/wiki/FDA_warning_letter) had been issued to supplement manufacturers marketing phenibut products as [adulterated](/wiki/Adulterant).[[12]](#cite_note-fda-19-12)\n\nPhenibut is used in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Latvia as a [pharmaceutical drug](/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug) to treat [anxiety](/wiki/Anxiety) and to improve [sleep](/wiki/Sleep) (e.g., in the treatment of [insomnia](/wiki/Insomnia)).[[5]](#cite_note-pmid11830761-5)[[6]](#cite_note-Phenibut-Label-6) It is also used for various other indications, including the treatment of [asthenia](/wiki/Asthenia),

and [hangovers](/wiki/Hangover) may occur.[[3]](#cite_note-pmid26693960-3) Due to its CNS depressant effects, people taking phenibut should refrain from potentially dangerous activities such as operating heavy machinery.[[6]](#cite_note-Phenibut-Label-6)[[7]](#cite_note-RLS-Phenibut-7) With prolonged use of phenibut, particularly at high doses, the [liver](/wiki/Liver) and [blood](/wiki/Blood) should be [monitored](/wiki/Medical_monitoring), due to risk of [fatty liver disease](/wiki/Fatty_liver_disease) and

with repeated use, leading to [dependence](/wiki/Substance_dependence).[[5]](#cite_note-pmid11830761-5)[*[needs update](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items)*] [Withdrawal](/wiki/Drug_withdrawal) symptoms may occur upon discontinuation, and, in recreational users taking high doses, have been reported to include severe rebound anxiety,

treatment.[[6]](#cite_note-Phenibut-Label-6)[[7]](#cite_note-RLS-Phenibut-7) There have been three associated deaths which found Phenibut in the users system but only one of these cases solely included Phenibut.[[15]](#cite_note-15)\n\nPhenibut may mutually potentiate and extend the duration of the effects of other CNS depressants, including [anxiolytics](/wiki/Anxiolytic),

[nootropics](/wiki/Nootropic) and elsewhere on the internet that phenibut increases dopamine. Three papers published in Russian by Soviet scientists in 1979, 1986, and 1990 report that phenibut increases dopamine in the striatum of rats and in the mouse brain.[[22]](#cite_note-dopaminw-22) The mechanism underlying this putative effect is unclear.[[22]](#cite_note-dopaminw-22) Structurally, phenibut can also be considered a derivative of [phenethylamine](/wiki/Phenethylamine), and some research suggests that phenibut antagonizes the action of phenethylamine.[[22]](#cite_note-dopaminw-22)\n\nLittle information thus far has been published on the clinical [pharmacokinetics](/wiki/Pharmacokinetics) of phenibut.[[5]](#cite_note-pmid11830761-5) The drug is reported to be well-[absorbed](/wiki/Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)).[[6]](#cite_note-Phenibut-Label-6) It [distributes](/wiki/Distribution_(pharmacology)) widely throughout the body and across the [blood–brain barrier](/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier).[[6]](#cite_note-Phenibut-Label-6) Approximately 0.1% of an administered dose of phenibut reportedly penetrates into the [brain](/wiki/Brain), with this said to occur to a much greater extent in young people and the elderly.[[6]](#cite_note-Phenibut-Label-6) Following a single 250&#160;mg dose in healthy volunteers, its [elimination half-life](/wiki/Elimination_half-life) was approximately 5.3&#160;hours and the drug was largely (63%) [excreted](/wiki/Excretion) in the [urine](/wiki/Urine) unchanged.[[5]](#cite_note-pmid11830761-5)\nSome limited information has been described on the pharmacokinetics of phenibut in recreational users taking much higher doses (e.g., 1–3&#160;grams) than typical clinical doses.[[3]](#cite_note-pmid26693960-3)[[23]](#cite_note-pmid25655145-23) In these individuals, the [onset of action](/wiki/Onset_of_action) of phenibut has been reported to be 2 to 4&#160;hours orally and 20 to 30&#160;minutes [rectally](/wiki/Rectal_administration), the [peak effects](/wiki/Cmax_(pharmacology)) are described as occurring 4 to 6&#160;hours following oral ingestion, and the total [duration](/wiki/Duration_of_action) for the oral route has been reported to be 15 to 24&#160;hours (or about 3 to 5 terminal half-lives).[[3]](#cite_note-pmid26693960-3)\n\nPhenibut is a [synthetic](/wiki/Synthetic_compound) [aromatic amino acid](/wiki/Aromatic_amino_acid). It is a [chiral molecule](/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry)) and thus has two potential [configurations](/wiki/Absolute_configuration), as (*R*)- and (*S*)-[enantiomers](/wiki/Enantiomer).[[18]](#cite_note-pmid18275958-18)\n\n### Structure and analogues\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Phenibut_and_analogues.png/500px-Phenibut_and_analogues.png)](/wiki/File:Phenibut_and_analogues.png)Chemical structures of phenibut and analogues.\nPhenibut is a [derivative](/wiki/Chemical_derivative) of the [inhibitory](/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential) neurotransmitter [GABA](/wiki/GABA).[[5]](#cite_note-pmid11830761-5) Hence, it is a [GABA analogue](/wiki/GABA_analogue).[[5]](#cite_note-pmid11830761-5) Phenibut is specifically the [analogue](/wiki/Structural_analog) of GABA with a [phenyl ring](/wiki/Phenyl_ring) substituted in at the β-position.[[5]](#cite_note-pmid11830761-5) As such, its chemical name is β-phenyl-γ-aminobutyric acid, which can be abbreviated as β-phenyl-GABA.[[5]](#cite_note-pmid11830761-5) The presence of the phenyl ring allows phenibut to cross the [blood–brain barrier](/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier) significantly, unlike GABA.[[5]](#cite_note-pmid11830761-5) Phenibut also contains the [trace amine](/wiki/Trace_amine) [β-phenethylamine](/wiki/%CE%92-phenethylamine) in its [structure](/wiki/Chemical_structure).[[5]](#cite_note-pmid11830761-5)\nPhenibut is closely related to a variety of other GABA analogues including [baclofen](/wiki/Baclofen) (β-(4-chlorophenyl)-GABA), [4-fluorophenibut](/wiki/4-fluorophenibut) (β-(4-fluorophenyl)-GABA), [tolibut](/wiki/Tolibut) (β-(4-methylphenyl)-GABA), [pregabalin](/wiki/Pregabalin) ((*S*)-β-isobutyl-GABA), [gabapentin](/wiki/Gabapentin) (1-(aminomethyl)cyclohexane acetic acid), and [GABOB](/wiki/GABOB) (β-hydroxy-GABA).[[5]](#cite_note-pmid11830761-5)[[20]](#cite_note-pmid26234470-20) It has almost the same chemical structure as baclofen, differing from it only in having a [hydrogen](/wiki/Hydrogen) atom instead of a [chlorine](/wiki/Chlorine) atom at the *para* position of the phenyl ring.[[5]](#cite_note-pmid11830761-5) Phenibut is also close in structure to pregabalin, which has an [isobutyl](/wiki/Isobutane) group at the β position instead of phenibut's phenyl ring.[[20]](#cite_note-pmid26234470-20)\nA [glutamate](/wiki/Glutamate)-derivative analogue of phenibut is [glufimet](/wiki/Glufimet) (dimethyl 3-phenylglutamate hydrochloride).[[24]](#cite_note-pmid28726197-24)\n\nA [chemical synthesis](/wiki/Chemical_synthesis) of phenibut has been published.[[13]](#cite_note-SivchikGrygoryan-13)\n\nPhenibut was synthesized at the [A.

          "abstract": "Phenibut is a gamma aminobutyric acid derivative with activity at &#x3b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA)B, A and &#x3b2;-phenethylamine receptors. It was developed as a drug in the former Soviet Union to overcome anxiety and improve cognitive function in military personnel. In the last decade, it has made inroads into the European and U.S. markets, being marketed for purported nootropic properties. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on phenibut, its toxicology, pharmacology, adverse health effects, and patterns of use. Publications in peer-reviewed journals were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. Available literature points to adverse side effects associated with intoxication, withdrawal, and addiction to phenibut. Some of these effects can be life-threatening, requiring hospitalization and therapeutic interventions. Supportive efforts are often complicated by a lack of knowledge regarding phenibut's toxicology and pharmacology. Ingestion of phenibut was often associated with concomitant use of other substances of abuse. As control over its online marketing seems unrealistic, current efforts need to be focused on the addition of phenibut to current drug screening tests and the development of generally accepted treatment strategies for phenibut-associated toxicities.",

It is indigenous to Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Papua New Guinea, where its dark green, glossy leaves, known as <b>kratom</b>, have been used in herbal medicine since at least the 19th century. They have also historically been consumed via chewing, smoking, and as a tea. Kratom has opioid-like properties and some stimulant-like effects. </p><p>The efficacy and safety of kratom are unclear. In 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated that there is no evidence that kratom is safe or effective for treating any condition. Some people take it for managing chronic pain, for treating opioid withdrawal symptoms, or for recreational purposes. It is under preliminary research for possible antipsychotic and antidepressant properties. Kratom contains over fifty alkaloids—primarily mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine—which act as partial agonists at μ-opioid receptors with complex, receptor-specific effects and additional interactions across various neural pathways. </p><p>Anecdotal reports describe increased alertness, physical energy, talkativeness, sociability, sedation, changes in mood, and pain relief following kratom use at various doses. The onset of effects typically begins within five to ten minutes and lasts for two to five hours. Common side effects include appetite loss, erectile dysfunction, nausea and constipation. More severe side-effects may include respiratory depression (decreased breathing), seizure, psychosis, elevated heart rate and blood pressure, trouble sleeping, and liver injury. Addiction is a possible risk with regular use: when use is stopped, withdrawal symptoms may occur. Serious toxicity is relatively rare and generally appears at high doses or when kratom is used with other substances. A small number of deaths have been connected to the use of kratom, most commonly when mixed with other substances. </p><p>As of 2018, kratom is a controlled substance in sixteen countries. Some countries, like Indonesia and Thailand, have recently moved toward regulated legal production for medical use. There is growing international concern about a possible threat to public health from kratom use. In some jurisdictions its sale and importation have been restricted, and several public health authorities have raised alerts. </p> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Kratom_leaves.jpg\"><img alt=\"Kratom has dark green oval-acuminate leaves and yellow globular flowers.\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Kratom_leaves.jpg/250px-Kratom_leaves.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"250\" height=\"141\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Kratom_leaves.jpg/500px-Kratom_leaves.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"4032\" data-file-height=\"2268\"></a><figcaption>Kratom flowers and foliage</figcaption></figure> <p><i>Mitragyna speciosa</i> is an evergreen tree in the genus <i>Mitragyna</i> that can grow to a height of 25&#160;m (82&#160;ft).

The leaves, ovate-acuminate in shape and opposite in growth pattern, are dark green, glossy on their upper surfaces, and can grow to over 14–20&#160;cm (5.5–7.9&#160;in) long and 7–12&#160;cm (2.8–4.7&#160;in) wide.

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) stated in 2013 that there is no legitimate medical use for kratom, and in 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said that there is no evidence that kratom is safe or effective for treating any condition, and that there are no approved clinical uses for kratom. </p><p>Kratom is commonly ingested by chewing, as a tea, powdered in capsules or pills, or extracted for use in liquids. Kratom is rarely smoked. Different varieties of kratom contain different relative proportions of alkaloids such as mitragynine. </p> <p>In cultures where the plant grows, kratom has been used in traditional medicine. The leaves are chewed to relieve musculoskeletal pain and increase energy, appetite, and sexual desire in ways similar to khat and coca. The leaves, or extracts from them, are used to heal wounds and as a local anesthetic. Extracts and leaves have been used to treat coughs, diarrhea, and intestinal infections. They are also used as intestinal deworming agents in Thailand. </p><p>Kratom is often used by workers in laborious or monotonous occupations to stave off exhaustion and as a mood-enhancer and painkiller. In Thailand, kratom was \"used as a snack to receive guests and was part of the ritual worship of ancestors and gods\". The herb is bitter and is generally combined with a sweetener. </p> <p>Because the withdrawal effects of kratom are often reported to be less severe than those associated with traditional opioids, some people use kratom in the attempt to manage opioid use disorder, though no clinical trials have been done supporting this use. As of 2018, there have been no formal trials to study the efficacy or safety of kratom to treat opioid addiction. Stanciu et al. conducted a review of all literature and found insufficient evidence for any conclusions concerning whether kratom is harmful or whether can serve as harm reduction for those with opioid addiction. While some literature reviews claim that kratom has less potential for dependence or overdose than traditional opioids, other reviews note that kratom withdrawal itself can still be quite severe. </p><p>Data on how widely it is used worldwide are lacking, as it is not detected by typical drug screening tests. Rates of kratom use appear to be increasing among those who have been self-managing chronic pain with opioids purchased without a prescription and are cycling (but not quitting) their opioid use. </p><p>In 1836, kratom was reported to have been used as an opium substitute in Malaysia. Kratom was also used as an opium substitute in Thailand in the 19th century. </p> <p>At low doses, kratom produces euphoric effects comparable to those of coca. At higher doses, kratom produces opioid-like effects. The onset of effects typically begins within five to ten minutes and lasts for two to five hours. Some anecdotal reports describe increased work capacity, alertness, talkativeness, sociability, increased sexual desire, positive mood, and euphoria following the consumption of kratom. </p><p>According to the U.S. DEA and a 2020 survey, kratom is used to alleviate pain, anxiety, depression, or opioid withdrawal. </p><p>In Thailand, a 2007 survey found that the lifetime, past year, and past 30 days kratom consumption rates were 2.32%, 0.81% and 0.57%, respectively, among respondents aged 12–65 years, and that kratom was the most widely used recreational drug in Thailand. </p><p>Kratom may be mixed with other psychoactive drugs, such as caffeine and codeine. Starting in the 2010s, a tea-based cocktail known as \"4×100\" became popular among some young people across Southeast Asia and especially in Thailand. It is a mix of kratom leaves, cough syrup, Coca-Cola, and ice. Around 2011, people who consumed the cocktail were often viewed more negatively than users of traditional kratom, but not as negatively as users of heroin. As of 2012, use of the cocktail was a severe problem among youth in three provinces along the border of Malaysia and southern Thailand. </p><p>In the U.S., as of 2015, kratom was available in outlets such as head shops and over the Internet; the prevalence of its U.S. use was unknown at the time. In the United States, kratom use increased rapidly between 2011 and 2017. By 2020, it was estimated that 15 million people worldwide use kratom. </p> <p><i>Mitragyna speciosa</i> may cause many adverse effects, and in November 2017 the FDA issued a public health advisory for the drug. The side effects of kratom appear to be dose-dependent and are more common with doses that exceed 8 g. While the incidence of adverse effects in people who use kratom is unknown, a 2019 review of 935 kratom exposures reported to U.S. poison control centers over a seven-year period listed the following signs and symptoms: agitation (18.6%), tachycardia (16.9%), drowsiness (13.6%), vomiting (11.2%), confusion (8.1%), seizures (6.1%), withdrawal symptoms (6.1%), hallucinations (4.8%), respiratory depression (2.8%), coma (2.3%), and cardiac or respiratory arrest (0.6%). The study also reported two deaths and four cases of neonatal abstinence syndrome. A different 2019 review listed as common side effects: decreased appetite, weight loss, erectile dysfunction, insomnia, sweating, hyperpigmentation, hair loss, tremor, and constipation. </p><p>Kratom products in the U.S. are commonly used in doses of 2–6 g of dried leaf, and doses exceeding 8 g are relatively uncommon. Given that kratom products may vary greatly in potency, there is no standard dosing system. At relatively low doses (1–5 g of raw leaves), at which there are mostly stimulant effects, side effects include contracted pupils and blushing; adverse effects related to stimulation include anxiety and agitation, and opioid-related effects such as itching, nausea, loss of appetite, and increased urination begin to appear. At moderate to high doses (5–15 g of raw leaves), at which opioid effects generally appear, additional adverse effects include tachycardia (an increased stimulant effect) as well as the opioid side effects of constipation, dizziness, hypotension, dry mouth, and sweating. </p><p>Long-term use of high doses of kratom may lead to development of tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal symptoms, including loss of appetite, weight loss, decreased libido, insomnia, muscle spasms, muscle and bone pain, increased yawning and/or sneezing, myoclonus, watery eyes, hot flashes, fever, diarrhea, restlessness, anger, and sadness. This may lead to resumption of use. </p><p>Frequent use of high doses of kratom may cause tremors, anorexia, weight loss, seizures, psychosis and other mental health conditions. Kratom use has a small but statistically significant association with externalizing mental health disorders. Kratom use may worsen existing mental health conditions. In case reports associating kratom use with psychosis, it remains unclear whether kratom use directly caused psychosis or simply unmasked the condition. Serious toxicity is relatively rare and generally appears at high doses or when kratom is used with other substances. Herb–drug interactions may result when kratom is combined with alcohol, sedatives, benzodiazepines, opioids, caffeine, cocaine, yohimbine, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Rhabdomyolysis is one of the rare and serious complications of this herb at high dosage. </p><p>In July 2016, the Centers for Disease Control issued a report stating that between 2010 and 2015, US poison control centers received 660 reports of exposure to kratom. Medical outcomes associated with kratom exposure were reported as minor (minimal signs or symptoms, which resolved rapidly with no residual disability) for 162 (24.5%) exposures, moderate (non-life-threatening, with no residual disability, but requiring some form of treatment) for 275 (41.7%) exposures, and major (life-threatening signs or symptoms, with some residual disability) for 49 (7.4%) exposures. Overall, 92.6% of outcomes were resolved with no residual disability. One death was reported in a person who was exposed to the medications paroxetine (an antidepressant) and lamotrigine (an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer) in addition to kratom. For 173 (26.2%) exposure calls, no effects were reported, or poison center staff members were unable to follow up regarding effects. </p><p>A 2019 report from the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) noted that kratom use was increasing rapidly, with 1807 kratom exposures and a 52-fold increase occurring over the years 2011 to 2017. Most exposures occurred intentionally by adult males in their homes, with 32% of the incidents requiring admission to a health care facility and half of the admissions as a serious medical condition. Multiple-substance exposures were associated with a higher number of hospitalizations than kratom-only exposures and involved 11 deaths, including two due to kratom alone. Post-mortem toxicology testing detected multiple substances for almost all those who died, with fentanyl and fentanyl analogs being the most frequently identified co-occurring substances. </p><p>Overdoses of kratom are managed similarly to opioid overdoses, and naloxone can be considered to treat an overdose that results in a reduced impulse to breathe, despite mixed results for its utility, based on animal models. </p><p>From October 2017 to February 2018 in the United States, 28 people in 20 different states were infected with salmonella, an outbreak linked to the consumption of contaminated pills, powder, tea, or unidentified sources of kratom. An analytical method using whole genome sequencing applied to samples from the infected users indicated that the salmonella outbreak likely had a common kratom source. </p> <p>Kratom is a botanical with a known addiction liability and, in vulnerable individuals, dependence may develop rather quickly with tolerance noted at three months and four- to ten-fold dose escalations required within the first few weeks. A survey by Stanciu et al. of kratom consumers found that 25.5% of respondents reported symptoms consistent with a substance use disorder diagnosis based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual's criteria. After controlling for variables such as age, gender, daily kratom use frequency, and a history of substance use disorders or mental health conditions, individuals with a concurrent diagnosis of another SUD had 2.83 times the odds of meeting criteria for kratom addiction compared to those without a concurrent substance use disorder diagnosis. Kratom addiction carries a relapse risk as high as 78% to 89% at three months post-cessation. In cases of severe addiction, an approach similar to the treatment of opioid addiction may be warranted. </p> <div><h3 >Respiratory depression</h3><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Mitragyna_speciosa&action=edit&section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Respiratory depression\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Respiratory depression is the leading cause of death from opioid use. Although evidence is sparse, the risk of respiratory depression caused by taking kratom appears to be low, but, as of 2016, the Food and Drug Administration listed respiratory depression as a concern. A 2018 review found that the alkaloids in kratom do not induce respiratory depression. </p> <p>Kratom use is thought to cause acute liver injury, with symptoms of abdominal discomfort, dark urine, itching and jaundice. Liver injury has been reported with a latency (time from first use to the onset of symptoms) of median 20.6 days. Reported liver biopsies tend to show cholestasis; however, blood biomarkers can show a range of cholestatic, mixed, or hepatocellular injury patterns. Although cases are likely underreported, many users do not seem to develop liver injury, and it is unclear which users are at heightened risk. The mechanism by which kratom causes liver damage in some people is unknown and poorly studied, but a model has been proposed. </p> <p>Kratom overdose is a subject of concern in many countries because of the associated rising number of hospitalizations and deaths in which chronic kratom use is a contributing factor. According to clinical reviews, a kratom overdose can cause liver toxicity, seizures, coma, and death, especially in combination with excessive alcohol use. Between 2011 and 2017, 44 U.S. deaths were kratom-related. However, many cases could not be fully assessed, due to limited information. People who die from kratom use typically have taken it in combination with other substances, or have underlying health conditions. </p><p>Over 18 months in 2016 and 2017, 152 overdose deaths involving kratom were reported in the United States, with kratom as the primary overdose agent in 91 of the deaths, and 7 with kratom being the only agent detected. Nine deaths occurred in Sweden during 2010–11 relating to use of <i>Krypton</i>, a mixture of kratom, caffeine and O-desmethyltramadol, a metabolite of the opioid analgesic tramadol. </p> <table> <caption><i>Mitragyna speciosa</i> alkaloids at opioid receptors </caption> <tbody><tr> <th rowspan=\"2\">Compound</th> <th colspan=\"3\">Affinities (<a href=\"/wiki/Inhibitor_constant\" title=\"Inhibitor constant\"><abbr title=\"Inhibitor constant\">K<sub>i</sub> (nM)</abbr></a>Tooltip Inhibitor constant)</th> <th>Ratio</th> <th rowspan=\"2\">Ref </th></tr> <tr> <th><a href=\"/wiki/%CE%9C-Opioid_receptor\" title=\"Μ-Opioid receptor\"><abbr title=\"μ-Opioid receptor\">MOR</abbr></a>Tooltip μ-Opioid receptor</th> <th><a href=\"/wiki/%CE%94-Opioid_receptor\" title=\"Δ-Opioid receptor\"><abbr title=\"δ-Opioid receptor\">DOR</abbr></a>Tooltip δ-Opioid receptor</th> <th><a href=\"/wiki/%CE%9A-Opioid_receptor\" title=\"Κ-Opioid receptor\"><abbr title=\"κ-Opioid receptor\">KOR</abbr></a>Tooltip κ-Opioid receptor</th> <th>MOR:DOR:KOR </th></tr> <tr> <td>7-Hydroxymitragynine</td> <td>13.5</td> <td>155</td> <td>123</td> <td>1:11:9</td> <td> </td></tr> <tr> <td>Mitragynine</td> <td>7.24</td> <td>60.3</td> <td>1,100</td> <td>1:8:152</td> <td> </td></tr> <tr> <td>Mitragynine pseudoindoxyl</td> <td>0.087</td> <td>3.02</td> <td>79.4</td> <td>1:35:913</td> <td> </td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Kratom contains at least 54 alkaloids. These include mitragynine, 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-HMG), speciociliatine, paynantheine, corynantheidine, speciogynine, mitraphylline, rhynchophylline, mitralactonal, raubasine, and mitragynaline. The alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are responsible for many of the complex effects of kratom, but other alkaloids may also contribute synergistically. </p><p>The effects of both mitragynine and 7-HMG remain disputed despite substantial study. Both are partial agonists of the μ-opioid receptor. While most data indicates agonism at all three opioid receptors, other data suggests the alkaloids are antagonists of the δ-opioid receptor with low affinity for the κ-opioid receptor. 7-HMG appears to have higher affinity at the μ-opioid receptor than mitragynine. These compounds display functional selectivity and do not activate the β-arrestin pathway partly responsible for the respiratory depression, constipation, and sedation associated with traditional opioids. Both mitragynine and 7-HMG readily cross the blood-brain barrier. </p><p>Mitragynine also appears to inhibit COX-2, block L-type and T-type calcium channels, and interact with other receptors in the brain including <a href=\"/wiki/5-HT2C_receptor\" title=\"5-HT2C receptor\">5-HT<sub>2C</sub></a> and <a href=\"/wiki/5-HT7_receptor\" title=\"5-HT7 receptor\">5-HT<sub>7</sub></a> serotonin receptors, <a href=\"/wiki/Dopamine_receptor_D2\" title=\"Dopamine receptor D2\">D<sub>2</sub></a> dopamine receptors, and <a href=\"/wiki/Adenosine_A2A_receptor\" title=\"Adenosine A2A receptor\">A<sub>2A</sub></a> adenosine receptors. Mitragynine stimulates <a href=\"/wiki/Alpha-2_adrenergic_receptor\" title=\"Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor\">α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors</a>, inhibiting the release of norepinephrine (noradrenaline); other compounds in this class include dexmedetomidine, which is used for sedation, and clonidine, which is used to manage anxiety and some symptoms of opioid withdrawal. This activity might explain why kratom can be dangerous when used in combination with other sedatives. Kratom also contains rhynchophylline, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist. </p><p>Mitragynine is metabolized in humans via phase I and phase II mechanisms with the resulting metabolites excreted in urine. In <i>in vitro</i> experiments, kratom extracts inhibited CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2 enzymes, which results in significant potential for drug interactions. </p> <table> <caption>Table 1: Pharmaceutical profile of Kratom </caption> <tbody><tr> <td colspan=\"2\">Kratom (Mitragynine, 7-Hydroxy-Mitragynine, Speciogynine, Paynantheine, Speciociliatine, Corynantheidine, Corynoxeine, Corynoxine B, Speciofoline) </td></tr> <tr> <td>Bioavailability: </td> <td>PO estimated at 30% </td></tr> <tr> <td>Onset: </td> <td>PO: 30 minutes </td></tr> <tr> <td>Peak plasma time: </td> <td>1-4.5 hrs </td></tr> <tr> <td>Duration: </td> <td>3 or more hours </td></tr> <tr> <td>Half-life: </td> <td>12–45 hours </td></tr> <tr> <td>Receptors: </td> <td><div><ul><li>Kappa: competitive antagonist</li><li>Delta: competitive antagonist</li><li>Mu: partial agonist</li><li><i>α</i>2 adrenergic</li><li>Adenosine A2a</li><li>Dopamine D2</li><li>Serotonin receptors 5-HT2C and 5-HT7</li></ul></div> </td></tr> <tr> <td>Mechanism of action: </td> <td>Competitive antagonist at Kappa opioid receptors with stronger affinity compared to other receptors, competitive antagonist at Delta opioid receptors.

In particular, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-HMG) compose significant proportions of the natural products isolable from <i>M. speciosa</i>; e.g., in one study, mitragynine was 12% by weight from Malaysian leaf sources, <i>versus</i> 66% from Thai sources, and 7-hydroxymitragynine constituted ~2% by weight. At least 40 other compounds have been isolated from <i>M. speciosa</i> leaves, including ~25 additional alkaloids, including raubasine/ajmalicine (originally isolated from <i>Rauvolfia serpentina</i>), corynantheidine (also found in <i>Corynanthe johimbe</i>), as well as mitraphylline, mitragynine pseudoindoxyl, and rhynchophylline. </p><p>In addition to alkaloids, <i>M. speciosa</i> produces many other secondary metabolites. These include various saponins, iridoids and other monoterpenoids, triterpenoids such as ursolic acid and oleanic acid, as well as various polyphenols including the flavonoids apigenin and quercetin. Although some of these compounds possess antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, gastrointestinal, antidepressant, antioxidant, and antibacterial effects in cells and non-human animals, there is no sufficient evidence to support the clinical use of kratom in humans. </p> <div><h3 >Detection in body fluids</h3><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Mitragyna_speciosa&action=edit&section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Detection in body fluids\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>The plant's active compounds and metabolites are not detected by a typical drug screening test but can be detected by more specialized testing.

Kratom can be marketed for other uses, such as incense. </p> <p>As of 2011, the plant was controlled in Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Sweden. </p><p>In Bulgaria and Norway, kratom is a controlled substance. </p><p>In the Czech Republic, regulated sales of kratom and kratom extracts became legal starting in July 2025. </p><p>In Finland, scheduled in the \"government decree on psychoactive substances banned from the consumer market\". </p><p>In the Republic of Ireland in 2017, kratom was designated a Schedule 1 illegal drug (the highest level), under the names 7-hydroxymitragynine and mitragynine. </p><p>In the UK, the sale, import, and export of kratom is prohibited under the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016, which broadly bans any substance that \"produces a psychoactive effect\". </p> <p>Chile banned Kratom in 2021. </p><p>Argentina banned Kratom in 2017. </p><p>Brazil listed kratom as a New Psychoactive Substance (NPS) in 2020. However, it remains legal until it is included among prohibited substances. </p> <p>Kratom was previously scheduled to become an illegal substance in Indonesia in 2024 once new regulations from the Indonesian National Narcotics Agency (BNN) go into effect. However, in 2024, a revision to a regulation by Ministry of Trade legalized production and export of kratom leaves. Later in September 2024, Indonesia's Ministry of Cooperatives and Small Medium Business stated that Indonesia will start building downstream industries for kratom exports. These developments made kratom legal to export and manufacture in Indonesia. </p> <p>Kratom is classified as a designated drug, and its manufacture, import, possession, and use, are illegal. </p> <p>The use of kratom leaves, known locally as <i>ketum or Biak</i> is prohibited to use, import, export, manufacture, compound, mix, dispense, sell, supply, administer or possess in Malaysia under Section 30(3) of the Poisons Act 1952, and will be punished by imprisonment or fine or both. Although prohibited by statute, the use of kratom remains widely spread especially in Northern and East Coast region of Malaysia's Peninsula because the tree grows natively and tea decoctions are readily available in local communities. Certain parties have urged the government to penalize the use of kratom under the Dangerous Drugs Act instead of the Poisons Act, which would carry heavier penalties. </p> <p>Possession of kratom was illegal in Thailand until 2018. The Thai government had passed the Kratom Act 2486, effective 3 August 1943, which made planting the tree illegal, in response to a rise in its use when opium became very expensive in Thailand and the government was attempting to gain control of the opium market. In 1979, the government placed kratom, along with cannabis, in Category V of a five-category classification of narcotics. Kratom accounted for less than two percent of arrests for narcotics between 1987 and 1992. </p><p>The Thai government has considered legalizing kratom for recreational use in 2004, 2009, 2013, and 2020. In 2018, Thailand became the first Southeast Asian country to legalize kratom for medical purposes. In 2021, Thailand fully legalized kratom and removed it from the list of Category V narcotics, and more than 12,000 people who had been convicted for kratom-related offences when it was still considered a narcotic were granted an amnesty. </p> <p>In 2014, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the import of kratom into the U.S. due to a lack of evidence for its safety. As of 2021, kratom is illegal in seven states: Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin, and it may be outlawed by local ordinance in other states. In 2025, it was banned in the following Massachusetts communities: Belchertown, Chelmsford, Dracut, Lowell, Marlborough, and Northampton. There was consideration in late 2017 to make kratom a Schedule I drug. In 2019, the FDA warned consumers that kratom remains unapproved for interstate commerce for use as a drug, may be unsafe in commercially available products, and is on an import alert, which can lead to confiscation of imported supplies. Efforts to schedule kratom generated significant controversy, both among the general public and the scientific community, and were ultimately unsuccessful. </p><p>On August 13, 2025, Florida attorney general James Uthmeier announced an emergency rule placing 7-hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I status under Florida state law, without any mention of a carve out or any exclusions for <i>Mitragyna speciosa</i> which contains low amounts of 7OH, effectively making kratom illegal in Florida. </p> <p>In April 2019, the FDA issued a statement declaring that kratom was not approved for any medical use, was potentially unsafe in commercial products available in the United States, and remained on an import alert where imported supplies would be confiscated. On April 4, 2018, the FDA issued the first mandatory recall in its history over concerns of salmonella contamination of several kratom-containing products. Samples of the products, manufactured by Triangle Pharmanaturals, and marketed under the brand name 'Raw Form Organics', tested positive for contamination and the manufacturer did not comply with federal requests for voluntary recall. FDA Commissioner Gottlieb stated that the recall was \"...based on the imminent health risk posed by the contamination of this product with salmonella\" and not related to other regulatory concerns. Consumers were advised to immediately discard any such products to prevent serious health risks. </p><p>In February 2018, the commissioner of the FDA, Scott Gottlieb, released a statement describing further opioid-like properties of kratom and stating that it should not be used for any medical treatment or recreational use. Also in 2018, the FDA supervised the voluntary destruction of kratom dietary supplements by a nationwide distributor in Missouri, and encouraged all companies involved in kratom commerce to remove their products from the market. On February 26, the FDA warned a California manufacturer of a kratom product called \"Mitrasafe\" that the supplement was not confirmed as safe, was not approved as a dietary supplement or drug, and was illegal for interstate commerce. </p><p>Although it was a federally legal dietary supplement, kratom was not approved as a therapeutic agent in the United States due to the poor quality of the research. In November 2017, the FDA cited serious concerns over the marketing and effects (including death) associated with the use of kratom in the United States, stating that \"There is no reliable evidence to support the use of kratom as a treatment for opioid use disorder; there are currently no FDA-approved therapeutic uses of kratom... and the FDA has evidence to show that there are significant safety issues associated with its use.\" </p> <p>On August 30, 2016, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) announced its intention to place the active materials in the kratom plant into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act as a warning about an imminent hazard to public safety, citing over 600 calls to poison control centers between 2010 and 2015 and 15 kratom-related deaths between 2014 and 2016. This drew strong protests among those using kratom to deal with chronic pain or wean themselves off opioids or alcohol. A group of 51 members of the U.S. House of Representatives and a group of nine Senators each sent letters to acting DEA administrator Chuck Rosenberg protesting the listing and around 140,000 people signed an online White House Petition protesting it. </p><p>The DEA noted the responses but said that it intended to go forward with the listing; a spokesman said: \"We can't rely upon public opinion and anecdotal evidence. We have to rely upon science.\" In October 2016, the DEA withdrew its notice of intent while inviting public comments over a review period ending on December 1, 2016. As of July 2016, Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Vermont, and Wisconsin had made kratom illegal, and the US Army had forbidden soldiers from using it. Between February 2014 and July 2016, U.S. law-enforcement authorities \"encountered 55 tons of kratom,\" or roughly \"50 million individual doses,\" according to the International Narcotics Control Board. </p> <p>The FDA's arguments for the federal prohibition of kratom have drawn both criticism and support. FDA commissioner Gottlieb responded to criticism in 2018 by stating that \"The FDA has done an exhaustive review of adverse event reports, clinical literature and other sources of information related to kratom.\" However, in 2021, former Acting Commissioner of Food and Drugs Brett Giroir claimed that the FDA's recommendation to schedule kratom was rejected because of \"embarrassingly poor evidence [and] data.\" The FDA's position on kratom has also been criticized by the <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=American_Kratom_Association&action=edit&redlink=1\" title=\"American Kratom Association (page does not exist)\">American Kratom Association</a> and researchers including Walter Prozialeck. Former commissioner Gottlieb continued to defend the agency's position in 2021, stating that he was convinced that kratom was fueling the U.S. opioid epidemic, though Gottlieb's partiality has been called into question as he has since gone on to become a member of the board of directors of Pfizer Inc., a company that has been heavily criticized for its sale and marketing of opioid drugs. </p> <div><h2 >Research directions</h2><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Mitragyna_speciosa&action=edit&section=28\" title=\"Edit section: Research directions\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Kratom is under preliminary research for possible antipsychotic and antidepressant properties, as well as pain management, withdrawal management, and dependence reduction. </p><p>Kratom use has not been shown to affect positive mental health and shows a very small association with negative indicators (mainly externalizing disorders). </p> <ul><li>Deumitragynine</li> <li><i>Pausinystalia johimbe</i></li></ul> <div><ol> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b> <cite><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/192376330/192376332\">\"<i>Mitragyna speciosa</i>\"</a>. <i>IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</i>. <b>2021</b> e.T192376330A192376332.

Extracts and leaves have been used to treat coughs, diarrhea, and intestinal infections.[[4]](#cite_note-Rech2015-4)[[5]](#cite_note-Hassan2013-5)[[21]](#cite_note-Eisenman-21) They are also used as intestinal deworming agents in Thailand.[[20]](#cite_note-EMCDDA-20)[[29]](#cite_note-29)\nKratom is often used by workers in laborious or monotonous occupations to stave off exhaustion and as a mood-enhancer and painkiller.[[21]](#cite_note-Eisenman-21) In Thailand, kratom was \"used as a snack to receive guests and was part of the ritual worship of ancestors and gods\".[[30]](#cite_note-30) The herb is bitter and is generally combined with a sweetener.[[23]](#cite_note-Adkins_2011-05-01-23)\n\nBecause the withdrawal effects of kratom are often reported to be less severe than those associated with traditional opioids,[[11]](#cite_note-warner-11) some people use kratom in the attempt to manage [opioid use disorder](/wiki/Opioid_use_disorder),[[31]](#cite_note-:2-31) though no clinical trials have been done supporting this use. As of 2018, there have been no formal trials to study the efficacy or safety of kratom to treat opioid addiction.[[7]](#cite_note-FDA2018-7) Stanciu et al. conducted a review of all literature and found insufficient evidence for any conclusions concerning whether kratom is harmful or whether can serve as harm reduction for those with opioid addiction.[[32]](#cite_note-32) While some [literature reviews](/wiki/Literature_review) claim that kratom has less potential for [dependence](/wiki/Substance_dependence) or [overdose](/wiki/Drug_overdose) than traditional opioids,[[33]](#cite_note-33)[[34]](#cite_note-:3-34) other reviews note that kratom withdrawal itself can still be quite severe.[[35]](#cite_note-Stan2019-35)\nData on how widely it is used worldwide are lacking, as it is not detected by typical drug screening tests.[[23]](#cite_note-Adkins_2011-05-01-23) Rates of kratom use appear to be increasing among those who have been self-managing chronic pain with opioids purchased without a prescription and are cycling (but not quitting) their opioid use.[[23]](#cite_note-Adkins_2011-05-01-23)\nIn 1836, kratom was reported to have been used as an opium substitute in Malaysia. Kratom was also used as an opium substitute in Thailand in the 19th century.[[5]](#cite_note-Hassan2013-5)\n\nAt low doses, kratom produces [euphoric](/wiki/Euphoria) effects comparable to those of [coca](/wiki/Coca).[[36]](#cite_note-:0-36) At higher doses, kratom produces opioid-like effects.[[36]](#cite_note-:0-36) The onset of effects typically begins within five to ten minutes and lasts for two to five hours.[[4]](#cite_note-Rech2015-4) Some anecdotal reports describe increased work capacity, alertness, talkativeness, [sociability](/wiki/Social_behavior), increased [sexual desire](/wiki/Sexual_desire), [positive mood](/wiki/Mood_(psychology)), and [euphoria](/wiki/Euphoria) following the consumption of kratom.[[11]](#cite_note-warner-11)\nAccording to the U.S. DEA and a 2020 survey, kratom is used to alleviate pain, anxiety, depression, or [opioid withdrawal](/wiki/Opioid_withdrawal).[[15]](#cite_note-usdea-15)[[37]](#cite_note-:1-37)\nIn Thailand, a 2007 survey found that the lifetime, past year, and past 30 days kratom consumption rates were 2.32%, 0.81% and 0.57%, respectively, among respondents aged 12–65 years,[[20]](#cite_note-EMCDDA-20) and that kratom was the most widely used recreational drug in Thailand.[[20]](#cite_note-EMCDDA-20)\nKratom may be mixed with other [psychoactive drugs](/wiki/Psychoactive_drug), such as [caffeine](/wiki/Caffeine) and [codeine](/wiki/Codeine).[[8]](#cite_note-Cin2015-8)[[38]](#cite_note-38) Starting in the 2010s, a tea-based cocktail known as \"4×100\"  became popular among some young people across Southeast Asia and especially in Thailand. It is a mix of kratom leaves, [cough syrup](/wiki/Cough_syrup), [Coca-Cola](/wiki/Coca-Cola), and ice. Around 2011, people who consumed the cocktail were often viewed more negatively than users of traditional kratom, but not as negatively as users of [heroin](/wiki/Heroin).[[39]](#cite_note-39) As of 2012, use of the cocktail was a severe problem among youth in three provinces along the border of Malaysia and southern Thailand.[[40]](#cite_note-40)\nIn the U.S., as of 2015, kratom was available in outlets such as [head shops](/wiki/Head_shop) and over the Internet; the prevalence of its U.S. use was unknown at the time.[[11]](#cite_note-warner-11) In the United States, kratom use increased rapidly between 2011 and 2017.[[41]](#cite_note-Post-41) By 2020, it was estimated that 15 million people worldwide use kratom.[[42]](#cite_note-42)\n\n*Mitragyna speciosa* may cause many adverse effects, and in November 2017 the FDA  issued a public health advisory for the drug.[[9]](#cite_note-white-9) The side effects of kratom appear to be [dose-dependent](/wiki/Dose%E2%80%93response_relationship) and are more common with doses that exceed 8 g.[[34]](#cite_note-:3-34) While the [incidence](/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)) of adverse effects in people who use kratom is unknown, a 2019 review of 935 kratom exposures reported to U.S. [poison control centers](/wiki/Poison_control_center) over a seven-year period listed the following signs and symptoms: agitation (18.6%), [tachycardia](/wiki/Tachycardia) (16.9%), [drowsiness](/wiki/Somnolence) (13.6%), [vomiting](/wiki/Vomiting) (11.2%), [confusion](/wiki/Confusion) (8.1%), [seizures](/wiki/Seizure) (6.1%), [withdrawal symptoms](/wiki/Drug_withdrawal) (6.1%), [hallucinations](/wiki/Hallucination) (4.8%), [respiratory depression](/wiki/Hypoventilation) (2.8%), [coma](/wiki/Coma) (2.3%), and [cardiac](/wiki/Cardiac_arrest) or [respiratory arrest](/wiki/Respiratory_arrest) (0.6%).[[43]](#cite_note-:5-43)[[34]](#cite_note-:3-34) The study also reported two deaths and four cases of [neonatal abstinence syndrome](/wiki/Neonatal_withdrawal).[[43]](#cite_note-:5-43) A different 2019 review listed as common side effects: [decreased appetite](/wiki/Decreased_appetite), [weight loss](/wiki/Weight_loss), [erectile dysfunction](/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction), [insomnia](/wiki/Insomnia), [sweating](/wiki/Sweating), [hyperpigmentation](/wiki/Hyperpigmentation), [hair loss](/wiki/Hair_loss), [tremor](/wiki/Tremor), and [constipation](/wiki/Constipation).[[14]](#cite_note-corkery-14)\nKratom products in the U.S. are commonly used in doses of 2–6 g of dried leaf, and doses exceeding 8 g are relatively uncommon.[[44]](#cite_note-44) Given that kratom products may vary greatly in potency, there is no standard dosing system. At relatively low doses (1–5 g of raw leaves), at which there are mostly stimulant effects, side effects include contracted pupils and blushing; adverse effects related to stimulation include anxiety and agitation, and opioid-related effects such as itching, nausea, loss of appetite, and increased urination begin to appear.[[4]](#cite_note-Rech2015-4)[[11]](#cite_note-warner-11) At moderate to high doses (5–15 g of raw leaves), at which opioid effects generally appear, additional adverse effects include [tachycardia](/wiki/Tachycardia) (an increased stimulant effect) as well as the opioid side effects of constipation, dizziness, hypotension, dry mouth, and sweating.[[11]](#cite_note-warner-11)[[16]](#cite_note-Rosen-16)[[45]](#cite_note-:4-45)\nLong-term use of high doses of kratom may lead to development of tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal symptoms, including loss of appetite, weight loss, decreased [libido](/wiki/Libido), insomnia, muscle spasms, muscle and bone pain, increased yawning and/or sneezing, [myoclonus](/wiki/Myoclonus), [watery eyes](/wiki/Lacrimation), [hot flashes](/wiki/Hot_flash), [fever](/wiki/Fever), [diarrhea](/wiki/Diarrhea), restlessness, anger, and sadness.[[8]](#cite_note-Cin2015-8) This may lead to resumption of use.[[8]](#cite_note-Cin2015-8)[[11]](#cite_note-warner-11)[[35]](#cite_note-Stan2019-35)\nFrequent use of high doses of kratom may cause tremors, anorexia, weight loss, [seizures](/wiki/Seizure), psychosis and other mental health conditions.[[11]](#cite_note-warner-11)[[46]](#cite_note-bachu-46) Kratom use has a small but statistically significant association with externalizing mental health disorders.[[47]](#cite_note-:12-47) Kratom use may worsen existing mental health conditions.[[46]](#cite_note-bachu-46) In case reports associating kratom use with psychosis, it remains unclear whether kratom use directly caused psychosis or simply unmasked the condition.[[48]](#cite_note-48) Serious toxicity is relatively rare and generally appears at high doses or when kratom is used with other substances.[[4]](#cite_note-Rech2015-4)[[11]](#cite_note-warner-11) [Herb–drug interactions](/wiki/Drug_interaction) may result when kratom is combined with [alcohol](/wiki/Alcoholic_drink), [sedatives](/wiki/Sedative), [benzodiazepines](/wiki/Benzodiazepine), [opioids](/wiki/Opioid), [caffeine](/wiki/Caffeine), [cocaine](/wiki/Cocaine), [yohimbine](/wiki/Yohimbine), or [monoamine oxidase inhibitors](/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_inhibitor) (MAOIs).[[45]](#cite_note-:4-45) [Rhabdomyolysis](/wiki/Rhabdomyolysis) is one of the rare and serious complications of this herb at high dosage.[[49]](#cite_note-pmid34430176-49)\nIn July 2016, the [Centers for Disease Control](/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control) issued a report stating that between 2010 and 2015, US [poison control centers](/wiki/Poison_control_center) received 660 reports of exposure to kratom. Medical outcomes associated with kratom exposure were reported as minor (minimal signs or symptoms, which resolved rapidly with no residual disability) for 162 (24.5%) exposures, moderate (non-life-threatening, with no residual disability, but requiring some form of treatment) for 275 (41.7%) exposures, and major (life-threatening signs or symptoms, with some residual disability) for 49 (7.4%) exposures.

We have to rely upon science.\"[[125]](#cite_note-125) In October 2016, the DEA withdrew its notice of intent while inviting public comments over a review period ending on December 1, 2016.[[126]](#cite_note-126)[[127]](#cite_note-127) As of July 2016, Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Vermont, and Wisconsin had made kratom illegal,[[128]](#cite_note-128) and the US Army had forbidden soldiers from using it.[[129]](#cite_note-129) Between February 2014 and July 2016, U.S. law-enforcement authorities \"encountered 55 tons of kratom,\" or roughly \"50 million individual doses,\" according to the [International Narcotics Control Board](/wiki/International_Narcotics_Control_Board).[[130]](#cite_note-130)\n\nThe FDA's arguments for the federal [prohibition](/wiki/Prohibition_of_drugs) of kratom have drawn both criticism and support.[[131]](#cite_note-:8-131)[[132]](#cite_note-:6-132)[[133]](#cite_note-:7-133) FDA commissioner Gottlieb responded to criticism in 2018 by stating that \"The FDA has done an exhaustive review of adverse event reports, clinical literature and other sources of information related to kratom.\"[[132]](#cite_note-:6-132) However, in 2021, former Acting [Commissioner of Food and Drugs](/wiki/Commissioner_of_Food_and_Drugs) [Brett Giroir](/wiki/Brett_Giroir) claimed that the FDA's recommendation to schedule kratom was rejected because of \"embarrassingly poor evidence [and] data.\"[[133]](#cite_note-:7-133) The FDA's position on kratom has also been criticized by the [American Kratom Association](/w/index.php?title=American_Kratom_Association&action=edit&redlink=1) and researchers including [Walter Prozialeck](/wiki/Walter_Prozialeck).[[131]](#cite_note-:8-131)[[132]](#cite_note-:6-132)[[134]](#cite_note-134) Former commissioner Gottlieb continued to defend the agency's position in 2021, stating that he was convinced that kratom was fueling the U.S. [opioid epidemic](/wiki/Opioid_epidemic), though Gottlieb's partiality has been called into question as he has since gone on to become a member of the board of directors of [Pfizer Inc.](/wiki/Pfizer_Inc.), a company that has been heavily criticized for its sale and marketing of opioid drugs.[[133]](#cite_note-:7-133)\n\n## Research directions\n\nKratom is under preliminary research for possible [antipsychotic](/wiki/Antipsychotic) and [antidepressant](/wiki/Antidepressant) properties, as well as [pain management](/wiki/Pain_management), withdrawal management, and dependence reduction.[[12]](#cite_note-ReferenceA-12)[[13]](#cite_note-Jack_T_2019-13)[[135]](#cite_note-135)\nKratom use has not been shown to affect positive mental health and shows a very small association with negative indicators (mainly externalizing disorders).[[47]](#cite_note-:12-47)\n\n- [Deumitragynine](/wiki/Deumitragynine)\n\n- *[Pausinystalia johimbe](/wiki/Pausinystalia_johimbe)*\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-1)** [\"*Mitragyna speciosa*\"](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/192376330/192376332). *[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species](/wiki/IUCN_Red_List)*. **2021** e.T192376330A192376332.

A review of the literature was performed to characterize kratom's pharmacology, clinical efficacy, and adverse effects to increase understanding and evaluate potential use as an alternative treatment for opioid dependence. Kratom use initiated as self-medication for an opioid use disorder or pain syndrome in the absence of effective alternatives is associated with a risk of kratom dependence, withdrawal, and life-threatening toxicity. The potential for a serious adverse reaction should discourage unregulated use of kratom products.",

          "abstract": "Achieving effective pain management is one of the major challenges associated with modern day medicine. Opioids, such as morphine, have been the reference treatment for moderate to severe acute pain not excluding chronic pain modalities. Opioids act through the opioid receptors, the family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate pain relief through both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Four types of opioid receptors have been described, including the &#x3bc;-opioid receptor (MOR), &#x3ba;-opioid receptor (KOR), &#x3b4;-opioid receptor (DOR), and the nociceptin opioid peptide receptor (NOP receptor). Despite the proven success of opioids in treating pain, there are still some inherent limitations. All clinically approved MOR analgesics are associated with adverse effects, which include tolerance, dependence, addiction, constipation, and respiratory depression. On the other hand, KOR selective analgesics have found limited clinical utility because they cause sedation, anxiety, dysphoria, and hallucinations. DOR agonists have also been investigated but they have a tendency to cause convulsions. Ligands targeting NOP receptor have been reported in the preclinical literature to be useful as spinal analgesics and as entities against substance abuse disorders while mixed MOR/NOP receptor agonists are useful as analgesics. Ultimately, the goal of opioid-related drug development has always been to design and synthesize derivatives that are equally or more potent than morphine but most importantly are devoid of the dangerous residual side effects and abuse potential. One proposed strategy is to take advantage of biased agonism, in which distinct downstream pathways can be activated by different molecules working through the exact same receptor. It has been proposed that ligands not recruiting &#x3b2;-arrestin 2 or showing a preference for activating a specific G-protein mediated signal transduction pathway will function as safer analgesic across all opioid subtypes. This review will focus on the design and the pharmacological outcomes of biased ligands at the opioid receptors, aiming at achieving functional selectivity.",

          "abstract": "Mitragyna speciosa (Rubiaceae), commonly known as kratom, is a tropical tree with a long history of traditional use in parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. In recent years, kratom has gained popularity for use as a recreational drug across the globe. Relatively new to the illicit market and used in a manner different from its traditional applications, preparations of kratom are touted by many as a safe and legal psychoactive product that improves mood, relieves pain, and may provide benefits in opiate addiction. Available literature was reviewed for M. speciosa via PubMed, Google Scholar, CINAHL, and EBSCO to summarize its traditional uses, phytochemical composition, pharmacology and toxicology of proposed active constituents, and potential for misuse and abuse. Research has demonstrated that both stimulant and sedative dose-dependent effects do exist, but a growing concern for the drug's effects and safety of use has resulted in national and international attention primarily due to an increase in hospital visits and deaths in several countries that are said to have been caused by extracts of the plant. The main active alkaloid substances in kratom, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, present with a range of CNS stimulant and depressant effects mediated primarily through monoaminergic and opioid receptors. Recently, Palm Beach County, located in the southeastern corridor of Florida, has considered regulating kratom due to public safety concerns following the death of a young adult. At the local, state, and even federal levels, governments are now being confronted with the task of determining the safety and the possible regulation of kratom extracts. There are currently no standard analytical screening techniques for mitragynine and its metabolites following ingestion limiting its detection to more sophisticated techniques like liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine kratom use. The growing concern of the abuse potential of kratom requires careful evaluation of its benefits and potential toxicities.",

<b>ostarine</b> and by the developmental code names <b>GTx-024</b>, <b>MK-2866</b>, and <b>S-22</b>, is a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) which is under development for the treatment of androgen receptor-positive breast cancer in women and for improvement of body composition (e.g., prevention of muscle loss) in people taking GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide. It was also under development for a variety of other indications, including treatment of cachexia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, muscle atrophy or sarcopenia, and stress urinary incontinence, but development for all other uses has been discontinued. Enobosarm was evaluated for the treatment of muscle wasting related to cancer in late-stage clinical trials, and the drug improved lean body mass in these trials, but it was not effective in improving muscle strength. As a result, enobosarm was not approved and development for this use was terminated. Enobosarm is taken by mouth. </p><p>Known possible side effects of enobosarm include headache, fatigue, anemia, nausea, diarrhea, back pain, adverse lipid changes like decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, changes in sex hormone concentrations like decreased testosterone levels, elevated liver enzymes, and liver toxicity, among others. The potential masculinizing effects of enobosarm, for instance in women, have largely not been evaluated and are unknown. The potential adverse effects and risks of high doses of enobosarm are also unknown. Enobosarm is a nonsteroidal SARM, acting as an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens and anabolic steroids like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). However, it shows dissociation of effect between tissues in preclinical studies, with agonistic and anabolic effects in muscle and bone, agonistic effects in breast, and partially agonistic or antagonistic effects in the prostate gland and seminal vesicles. The AR-mediated effects of enobosarm in many other androgen-sensitive tissues are unknown. </p><p>Enobosarm was first identified in 2004 and has been under clinical development since at least 2005. It is the most well-studied SARM of all of the agents that have been developed. According to GTx, its developer, a total of 25 clinical studies have been carried out on more than 1,700 people involving doses from 1 to 100&#160;mg as of 2020. However, enobosarm has not yet completed clinical development or been approved for any use. As of November 2023, it is in phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of breast cancer and is in phase 2 studies for improvement of body composition in people taking GLP-1 receptor agonists. Enobosarm was developed by GTx, Inc., and is now being developed by Veru, Inc. </p><p>Aside from its development as a potential pharmaceutical drug, enobosarm is on the World Anti-Doping Agency list of prohibited substances and is sold for physique- and performance-enhancing purposes by black-market Internet suppliers. In one survey, 2.7% of young male gym users reported using SARMs. In addition, a London wastewater analysis found that enobosarm was the most abundant \"pharmaceutical drug\" detected and was more prevalent than \"classical\" recreational drugs like MDMA and cocaine. Enobosarm is often used in these contexts at doses greatly exceeding those evaluated in clinical trials, with unknown effectiveness and safety. Many products sold online that are purported to be enobosarm either contain none or contain other unrelated substances. Social media has played an important role in facilitating the widespread non-medical use of SARMs. </p> <p>Enobosarm is not approved for any medical use and is not available as a licensed pharmaceutical drug as of 2023. </p> <p>General side effects that have been reported with enobosarm in clinical trials include headache, fatigue, anemia, nausea, diarrhea, and back pain. </p><p>Enobosarm has shown dose-related adverse effects on serum lipids, sex hormone and gonadotropin levels, and carrier protein levels in clinical trials. It decreases HDL cholesterol levels, reducing them dose-dependently by 17% at a dose of 1&#160;mg/day and by 27% at a dose of 3&#160;mg/day. Decreases in total cholesterol levels and in triglyceride levels have also been seen, whereas LDL cholesterol levels are unchanged. In healthy elderly men, total testosterone levels decreased significantly at doses of 1 and 3&#160;mg/day (-31% and -57%, respectively), whereas levels of free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), estradiol, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) did not change significantly at doses up to 3&#160;mg/day. In healthy postmenopausal women, LH and FSH decreased significantly only at the 3&#160;mg/day dose (-17% and -30%, respectively), whereas levels of total testosterone, free testosterone, DHT, and estradiol did not clearly change relative to placebo. SHBG levels were lowered at doses of 1 to 3&#160;mg/day, decreasing dramatically by 61% in men and by 80% in women at the 3&#160;mg/day dose. For comparison, testosterone enanthate by intramuscular injection at a highly <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/supraphysiological\" title=\"wikt:supraphysiological\">supraphysiological</a> dose of 600&#160;mg/week resulted in only a 31% decrease in SHBG levels. Despite the large changes in SHBG levels, levels of free testosterone did not significantly change in either men or women. Small but significant increases in hemoglobin and hematocrit, and small but significant decreases in fasting blood glucose, insulin levels, and insulin resistance, have been observed with enobosarm at 3&#160;mg/day. </p><p>In small short-term (3-month) clinical trials in healthy elderly or postmenopausal women, enobosarm at doses ranging from 0.1 to 3&#160;mg/day had mixed effects on sebum production and did not increase body hair growth or cause hirsutism. These effects are measures of androgenic action in skin and hair follicles. In the first study, at doses of 0.1 to 3&#160;mg/day, there were no significant changes relative to placebo in sebum tape scores with enobosarm and there were no consistent increases in Ferriman–Gallwey score, with most women having no change in score or a decreased score and only one having an increase in score. In the second study, which employed 3&#160;mg/day enobosarm, there was a significant 1.25-fold increase in sebum production from baseline and a significant 1.5-fold increase in sebum production relative to placebo. No differences in sebaceous gland volume were apparent upon histological examination in this study. </p><p>At doses ranging from 0.1 to 18&#160;mg/day in clinical trials, enobosarm has been associated with elevated liver enzymes in subsets of individuals. Rates of elevated liver enzymes or of elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have ranged from 0.6% to 33% in these trials. Liver enzyme elevations with enobosarm are often transient and resolve spontaneously. However, markedly elevated liver enzymes have occasionally occurred with enobosarm in clinical trials and have necessitated discontinuation. There have been several published case reports of hepatotoxicity with enobosarm as of 2023. Between 2020 and 2022, there has been a rapid increase in reported cases of liver toxicity with SARMs. The hepatotoxicity with SARMs may be related to their resistance to hepatic metabolism, analogously to the case of 17α-alkylated anabolic steroids. </p><p>SARMs are often advertised and sold on the Internet at doses higher than have been described in the literature. Sometimes doses are recommended as several-fold or more greater than the doses used in clinical trials, or seemingly arbitrary doses are advised. For instance, enobosarm has been provided at doses of greater than or equal to 20&#160;mg per serving and recommended by bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts at doses of 10 to 30&#160;mg/day, relative to the most widely assessed highest dose in clinical trials of 3&#160;mg/day—an up to 10-fold difference. SARMs, particularly when used at high or excessive doses for prolonged periods of time, may result in substantial suppression of endogenous sex hormones like testosterone and estradiol, in turn producing widespread unintended deleterious effects on physiological function. As examples, SARMs may produce potent anabolic effects with deficiency in important androgenic effects, may result in estrogen deficiency with consequences like bone loss among others, and, due to suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis), may cause infertility. </p><p>Androgens and anabolic steroids like testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), nandrolone, and oxandrolone, which are full agonists of the androgen receptor, produce virilizing or masculinizing effects like increased sebum production and acne, increased body hair growth, scalp hair loss, voice deepening, increased muscle mass, android fat redistribution, skeletal changes like widening of the shoulders and skull/facial changes, and genital growth both in males and females. SARMs, which are tissue-selective mixed or partial agonists of the androgen receptor, are largely uncharacterized in terms of their masculinizing effects, but are likely to produce many of the same effects. SARMs specifically may be expected to retain masculinizing effects like increased muscle mass and bone changes, while possibly having reduced virilizing effects in certain other areas like androgenic skin and hair changes. Anecdotal reports of masculinization with SARMs in women exist in online forums. </p><p>The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cautioned that SARMs could have serious adverse effects ranging from risk of heart attack to stroke and liver damage and has warned against their use in bodybuilding products. </p> <p>Enobosarm has been assessed in clinical trials at doses ranging from 0.1 to 18&#160;mg/day. However, most research has been done at doses of 0.1 to 3&#160;mg/day, with two phase 3 clinical trials using a dosage of 3&#160;mg/day. A few small phase 1 and phase 2 trials of enobosarm for breast cancer have employed doses of 9 to 18&#160;mg/day. Larger, phase 3 trials of enobosarm at a dose of 9&#160;mg/day for breast cancer (e.g., ARTEST, n=210) are now underway. Doses of up to 100&#160;mg have been assessed in single-dose pharmacokinetic studies and doses of up to 30&#160;mg/day have been given in short 14-day pharmacokinetic studies. Enobosarm sold via black-market Internet suppliers and used non-medically is often taken at much higher doses than those used widely in clinical trials (e.g., 10–30&#160;mg/day), with unknown adverse effects and risks. </p> <p>Enobosarm is a substrate of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 and the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes UGT1A1 and UGT2B7. It shows very minimal metabolism by cytochrome P50 enzymes, with CYP3A4 merely responsible for the greatest degree of metabolism. Since enobosarm is metabolized by CYP3A4, UGT1A1, and UGT2B7, inhibitors and inducers of these enzymes can modify the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of enobosarm. The strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole was shown to have minimal to no influence on the pharmacokinetics of enobosarm, whereas the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampin reduced enobosarm peak levels by 23%, elimination half-life by 23%, and area-under-the-curve levels by 43%. The pan-UGT inhibitor probenecid was shown to not affect peak levels of enobosarm but to increase the elimination half-life of enobosarm by 78% and to increase area-under-the-curve levels of enobosarm by 50%. Enobosarm had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of celecoxib (a CYP2C9 substrate) or rosuvastatin (a BCRP substrate). Based on the preceding findings, it was concluded that enobosarm poses low risk for clinically relevant drug interactions. </p> <p>Enobosarm is a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM), or a tissue-selective mixed agonist or partial agonist of the androgen receptor (AR). This receptor is the biological target of endogenous androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and of synthetic anabolic steroids like nandrolone and oxandrolone. The affinity (K<sub>i</sub>) of enobosarm for the AR is high and was measured as 3.8&#160;nM in one study, or approximately 16.8% of that of DHT. Enobosarm shows enantioselectivity for the AR and has similar but somewhat lower potency than DHT in terms of activating the receptor. In addition to general activation of the AR, enobosarm induces the N/C interaction (the interaction of the amino terminus and carboxyl terminus) of the AR less potently than does DHT, but in any case promotes the N/C interaction concentration-dependently and to the same maximal extent as DHT. The AR is widely expressed in tissues throughout the body, including in the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, genitals, gonads, skin, hair follicles, muscle, bone, heart, adrenal cortex, liver, kidneys, and brain, among others. The effects of SARMs including enobosarm in many of these tissues have yet to be characterized. In any case, enobosarm has been demonstrated to have varying full agonist or partial agonist or antagonist actions in specific tissues, including potent agonistic and anabolic effects in muscle and bone, potent agonistic effects in AR-expressing human breast cancer cell lines like MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, and partially agonistic or antagonistic effects in the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and uterus. Enobosarm has additionally been shown to stimulate sexual motivation in female rats similarly to testosterone. Although enobosarm has not been specifically assessed in this area, another structurally unrelated quinolinone SARM, LGD-2226, has shown prosexual effects in male rats comparable to those of the synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid fluoxymesterone as well. </p><p>The molecular mechanisms underlying the tissue-selective effects of enobosarm and other SARMs compared to testosterone and other androgens and anabolic steroids remain unknown. However, recruitment of both coactivators and corepressors instead of only coactivators and resultant differing receptor conformations, distinct tissue-specific modulation of signaling pathways mediating genomic and non-genomic effects, and differences in within-tissue ligand metabolism and modulation of ligand potency (i.e., potentiation versus lack thereof), among others, all constitute possible mechanisms. In terms of coregulator recruitment, the ratios of coactivators to corepressors vary in different tissues throughout the body, and it is thought that SARMs may have agonistic effects in tissues with an excess of coactivators relative to corepressors like muscle and bone and may have partially agonistic or antagonistic effects in tissues with an excess of corepressors over coactivators like the prostate. Another mechanism may be that SARMs like enobosarm induce the N/C interaction less readily than AR full agonists like DHT. Induction of the N/C interaction has been associated with the effects of endogenous and exogenous AR agonists, for instance virilization and prostate growth. </p><p>In animal studies, enobosarm has shown potent muscle-promoting effects that were similar to those of testosterone and DHT. In one of the first published studies, enobosarm maximally restored prostate weight to 51%, seminal vesicle weight to 98%, and levator ani muscle weight to 136% in castrated male rats relative to gonadally intact control male rats, with an <a href=\"/wiki/Effective_dose_(pharmacology)\" title=\"Effective dose (pharmacology)\">ED<sub>50</sub></a> dose for muscle of 0.03&#160;mg/day. For comparison, testosterone propionate was able to maximally stimulate levator ani muscle to 104% and prostate weight to 121%, with ED<sub>50</sub> doses of 0.15&#160;mg/day and 0.13&#160;mg/day, respectively. Hence, enobosarm was able to stimulate the levator ani muscle to a size greater than that in normal male rats or produced with exogenous testosterone in castrated male rats, but was only capable of partially rescuing prostate gland weight. Additionally, enobosarm fully maintained or restored levator ani weight at doses that did not affect LH or FSH levels in gonadally intact animals (≤0.1&#160;mg/day). As such, it was more potent in stimulating muscle than testosterone at doses that did not affect gonadotropin levels. In gonadally intact male rats, enobosarm significantly increased levator ani muscle weight to 131% of intact controls but significantly decreased the weights of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles, demonstrating an antagonistic or partially agonistic effect in these tissues. In another animal study, enobosarm and DHT increased levator ani weights to similar or slightly different extents in intact male rats, but DHT strongly increased prostate weight while enobosarm reduced prostate weight. Aside from effects in muscle tissue, enobosarm has been assessed and found to completely maintain bone quality and composition in castrated male rats and to partially but not fully prevent bone loss in ovariectomized female rats, indicating potent anabolic effects in bone as well. </p><p>In a phase 2 human clinical trial in healthy elderly men and postmenopausal women, enobosarm dose-dependently increased lean body mass (muscle mass) across doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3&#160;mg/day, with a significant 1.3&#160;kg gain over placebo at 3&#160;mg/day and a non-significant 0.7&#160;kg gain over placebo at 1&#160;mg/day. Similarly, in two phase 3 clinical trials in men and postmenopausal women with muscle wasting due to non-small-cell lung cancer, enobosarm at 3&#160;mg/day significantly increased lean body mass by 0.41&#160;kg and 0.47&#160;kg. However, enobosarm did not successfully increase muscle strength in these phase 3 trials. In any case, it has been suggested that the study designs and physical function outcomes in such trials may have been flawed. The increases in lean body mass that have been seen with employed doses of enobosarm in clinical trials are very modest compared to those produced with supraphysiological doses of testosterone over similar timeframes (e.g., 0.5–1.5&#160;kg with enobosarm versus 5–8&#160;kg with 300–600&#160;mg/week intramuscular testosterone enanthate in healthy young men). The effects of higher doses of enobosarm (9–18&#160;mg/day) on lean body mass and muscle strength are also being evaluated in women with breast cancer. There is some evidence that women may be more sensitive to lean body mass increases with SARMs, specifically GSK-2881078 but potentially also others like enobosarm, than men. </p><p>In addition to its mixed agonist–antagonist activity at the AR, enobosarm is likely to also differ from steroidal androgens in its effects due to differences in within-tissue ligand metabolism. The virilizing and androgenic effects of the traditional steroidal androgens like testosterone in skin, hair follicles, and the prostate gland are attributed to high expression of 5α-reductase in these tissues and consequent local conversion and potentiation into more potent androgens. In the case of testosterone, this is via conversion into the 10-fold more potent androgen DHT. Enobosarm is not subject to this local transformation and potentiation, and so is theorized to have greatly reduced effects in these tissues relative to testosterone and certain other steroidal androgens. This is likewise theorized to be the case for non-5α-reductase-potentiated anabolic steroids like nandrolone and oxandrolone, which have high myotrophic–androgenic potency ratios in animals. The lack of 5α-reduction may result in reduced androgenic side effects like scalp hair loss, facial and body hair growth, and prostate growth. On the other hand, although SARMs, like enobosarm, as well as anabolic steroids, may have reduced virilizing effects in skin and hair follicles, this is not necessarily the case for virilization in general. In particular, the muscle-promoting effects of these agents can be considered a masculinizing effect. The potential masculinizing effects of enobosarm and SARMs in general are largely uncharacterized and unknown. Aside from metabolism differences related to 5α-reduction, enobosarm has also shown much greater impact in the liver, specifically on certain aspects of hepatic protein synthesis like reduction of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) production, than even highly <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/supraphysiological\" title=\"wikt:supraphysiological\">supraphysiological</a> doses of parenteral testosterone. This phenomenon has also been seen with other SARMs, such as LGD-4033, as well as with synthetic orally active 17α-alkylated anabolic steroids like stanozolol. It can be attributed to the first pass through the liver with oral administration and to the high oral bioavailability and strong resistance to hepatic metabolism of these agents. </p><p>Enobosarm has no estrogenic activity, either intrinsic to itself or via its metabolites. As a result, the drug is not expected to have feminizing effects or risk of gynecomastia (breast development) nor to stimulate estrogen-sensitive breast cancer. SARMs like enobosarm are not ideal agents for androgen replacement therapy as they are not expected to reproduce the full spectrum of effects of testosterone and other androgens, including not only AR-mediated effects but also notably aromatization into estrogen and required physiological estrogenic effects in bone and brain. Enobosarm has been found to be a weak antagonist of the progesterone receptor and hence might have some capacity for antiprogestogenic effects. Aside from its weak interaction with the progesterone receptor, enobosarm is highly selective for the AR and does not bind to other nuclear hormone receptors. </p> <p>Enobosarm is orally bioavailable due to a lack of extensive first-pass metabolism. In rats, the oral bioavailability of enobosarm was found to be 100%. Enobosarm is rapidly absorbed with oral administration and reaches maximal concentrations median 1.0&#160;hours (range 1.0–2.0&#160;hours) following administration. The drug reaches a peak concentration of 56.0&#160;ng/mL (range 53.1–123.0&#160;ng/mL) following a single 3&#160;mg dose and a steady-state peak of 68.1&#160;ng/mL following repeated 3&#160;mg doses. The pharmacokinetics of enobosarm are linear and proportional over a dose range of 1 to 100&#160;mg in single doses in healthy men. The pharmacokinetics of enobosarm are similar in young versus elderly individuals. A <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/concentration-time_curve\" title=\"wikt:concentration-time curve\">concentration–time curve</a> of enobosarm levels following a single oral dose of enobosarm in humans has been published. </p> <p>Enobosarm is a small-molecule and highly lipophilic compound. Compounds of this type are typically able to diffuse freely through biological membranes such as cell membranes and barriers like the blood–brain barrier. This is in fact essential for the action of nuclear receptor ligands like enobosarm since their biological targets (the androgen receptor in this case) are located intracellularly. One <i>in silico</i> study predicted that, on the basis of its overall physicochemical properties (but not considering active transport), enobosarm would be unlikely to cross the blood–brain barrier and hence would be a peripherally selective drug with reduced or no central nervous system effects. However, in a rat tissue distribution study, enobosarm was found to be concentrated in brain tissues to a similar extent as other target tissues like skeletal muscle, bone, prostate, and seminal vesicles. This is consistent with enobosarm producing centrally mediated effects in humans like suppression of LH and FSH secretion. </p><p>Enobosarm does not bind to sex hormone-binding globulin. </p> <p><i>In vitro</i> studies found very minimal metabolism of enobosarm by human cytochrome P450 enzymes. The greatest degree of oxidative metabolite generation occurred with CYP3A4. Upon incubation with human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes, enobosarm glucuronide was generated, with a majority of this inactive metabolite being produced by UGT1A1 and UGT2B7. Enobosarm glucuronide is the primary circulating metabolite of enobosarm. </p><p>Coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole had minimal impact on the pharmacokinetics of enobosarm and enobosarm glucuronide, whereas the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampin reduced enobosarm peak levels by 23%, elimination half-life by 23%, and area-under-the-curve levels by 43%. Coadministration of the pan-UGT inhibitor probenecid with enobosarm resulted in similar peak levels of enobosarm but the elimination half-life of enobosarm was extended by 78% and area-under-the-curve levels increased by 50%. These data are consistent with the preclinical findings that enobosarm is a substrate of CYP3A4 and UGT enzymes. </p><p>The metabolism of enobosarm is similar to that of the closely structurally related drug bicalutamide. </p> <p>In rats, enobosarm was excreted approximately 70% in feces and 21 to 25% in urine. </p><p>Enobosarm has an elimination half-life of approximately 14 to 24&#160;hours in human volunteers. In one pharmacokinetic study, the mean terminal half-life was 22.0 ± 5.8 (SD) hours, with a range of 13.7 to 31.3&#160;hours in different individuals </p> <p>Enobosarm is a small-molecule (molecular weight = 389.3&#160;g/mol) and highly lipophilic (predicted log P = 2.7–3.3) compound. </p><p>Enobosarm and related SARMs like acetothiolutamide, andarine (acetamidoxolutamide; GTx-007; S-4), and GTx-027 were derived from structural modification of the arylpropionamide nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide. They are nonsteroidal arylpropionamides themselves and are close structural analogues of bicalutamide. Bicalutamide was used to derive acetothiolutamide, andarine was developed from acetothiolutamide, the SARM S-1 was developed from andarine, and finally enobosarm was developed from S-1. Bicalutamide is used clinically as an antiandrogen, but there is some evidence that bicalutamide itself may have some SARM-like properties in certain tissues, for instance in muscle and bone. </p><p>Enobosarm (S-22) and andarine (S-4) and their chemical structures have sometimes been confused. The chemical structure of enobosarm was not disclosed until November 2011. </p><p>Novel nonsteroidal antiandrogens have been developed from enobosarm with enhanced potency and activity relative to conventional antiandrogens like bicalutamide and enzalutamide. </p> <p>The first SARMs were arylpropionamides derived from the nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide. They were discovered by James T. Dalton and colleagues at the University of Tennessee and other institutions and were first described in a paper published in 1998. At the time, these AR agonists were referred to as \"nonsteroidal androgens\", a drug class that had not been previously described. By 1999 however, on the basis of the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM)-like mixed agonist–antagonist and tissue-selective activity of these nonsteroidal AR agonists, the term \"selective androgen receptor modulator\" or \"SARM\" was introduced and adoption of this name had begun. The arylpropionamide SARM andarine (GTx-007; S-4) was first described in the literature by 2002. In 2003, arylpropionamide AR agonists, including andarine, were first reported to possess SARM-type tissue selectivity <i>in vivo</i>. Enobosarm (GTx-024; S-22), another arylpropionamide SARM, was first identified in 2004 and was first described in the literature in 2005. GTx, a pharmaceutical company founded in Memphis, Tennessee in 1997, licensed the rights to enobosarm from the University of Tennessee Research Foundation and began developing it as a pharmaceutical drug. </p><p>A phase 1 clinical trial employing enobosarm had been completed by 2005. By 2007, enobosarm was in a phase 2 trial, and that year GTx signed an exclusive license agreement for its SARM program with Merck &amp; Co. The companies ended the deal in 2010. In August 2011, there was a 12-week double-blind, placebo controlled phase 2 trial that focused on elderly men and postmenopausal women which concluded that enobosarm showed statistically significant improvements in total lean body mass and physical function without apparent adverse effects on hair growth or sebum production. In August 2013, GTx announced that enobosarm had failed in two phase 3 clinical trials to treat wasting in people with lung cancer. The company had invested around $35 million in the development of the drug. The company said at that time that it planned to pursue approval of enobosarm in Europe; the company was also still developing GTx-758, a nonsteroidal estrogen, for castration-resistant prostate cancer. As of 2018, enobosarm was the only SARM to have reached or completed phase 3 clinical trials. </p><p>In 2016, GTx began phase 2 trials, to see if enobosarm might be effective to treat stress urinary incontinence in women. In 2018, GTx announced the phase 2 trials on the effectiveness of enobosarm for stress urinary incontinence in women failed to achieve its primary endpoint in the ASTRID Trial. By September 2023, development of enobosarm for stress urinary incontinence had been discontinued. In 2022, the FDA granted fast tract designation to enobosarm in AR+, ER+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer. In January 2024, Veru Inc. submitted an Investigational New Drug application to the FDA of enobosarm for prevention of muscle loss and augmentation of fat loss in combination with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists like semaglutide for weight loss. In addition, they announced plans to conduct a phase 2b study of enobosarm at doses of 3 to 6&#160;mg/day for this purpose in sarcopenic obese or overweight elderly individuals receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists. </p><p>Enobosarm was developed by GTx, Inc., and is now being developed by Veru, Inc. </p> <div><h2 >Society and culture</h2><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Enobosarm&action=edit&section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Society and culture\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Enobosarm is the generic name of the drug and its International Nonproprietary Name (INN). Ostarine was a tentative brand name of the drug created by GTx, Inc. that did not end up being used for marketing purposes but continues to be used as a synonym for the drug. Enobosarm is also known by the pharmaceutical developmental code names S-22 (synthesis paper), GTx-024 (GTx, Inc.), MK-2866 (Merck), and VERU-024 (Veru, Inc.). </p> <p>Enobosarm and other SARMs are sold by black-market vendors on the Internet. These agents have increasingly become used by the general public as \"gym supplements\" such as pre-workout or lifestyle drugs, rather than as an aid to performance in athletic or bodybuilding competitions. In one survey, 2.7% of young male gym users in the Netherlands reported using SARMs. In addition, a 2018 analysis of a fatberg from a sewer in central London showed enobosarm to be the most abundant \"pharmaceutical drug\" detected, and was present at higher concentration than recreational drugs such as MDMA and cocaine. While this isolated result may not be representative of overall levels of use, for enobosarm to be detectable in sewer deposits reflects significant levels of enobosarm use in the area close to where the sample was collected. Doses of enobosarm sold online and used non-medically are often many times higher than those assessed in clinical trials. Aside from enobosarm, the other most commonly used SARMs include vosilasarm (RAD140; \"testolone\"), LGD-4033 (VK5211; \"ligandrol\"), and andarine (GTx-007; S-4). Many products sold online that are purported to be enobosarm either contain none or contain other unrelated substances, and doses are also frequently not as labeled. Social media has played an important role in facilitating the widespread non-medical use of SARMs. </p> <p>SARMs including enobosarm may be and have been used by athletes to assist in training and increase physical stamina and fitness, potentially producing effects similar to anabolic steroids. For this reason, SARMs were banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency in January 2008, despite no drugs from this class yet being in clinical use, and blood tests for all known SARMs have been developed. There are a variety of known cases of doping in sports with enobosarm by professional athletes. </p> <div><h4 >List of doping cases</h4><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Enobosarm&action=edit&section=18\" title=\"Edit section: List of doping cases\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>In May 2017, Dynamic Technical Formulations voluntarily recalled all lots of Tri-Ton, a dietary supplement that the FDA tested and found to contain Enobosarm and andarine. </p><p>In October 2018, UFC fighter Sean O'Malley tested positive for Enobosarm and was suspended by the Nevada State Athletic Commission and USADA for six months. O'Malley tested positive again on May 25, 2019 and was suspended for nine months by the same agencies. USADA determined that none of O'Malley's positive tests were consistent with intentional use and he was allowed to compete at UFC 248 as long as he kept his levels below the threshold of 100&#160;ng/ml. </p><p>On January 7, 2019, the College National Football Championship was played between University of Alabama and Clemson University. Prior to the College Football National Championship game, three Clemson players who were suspended —</span> Dexter Lawrence, Braden Galloway and Zach Giellaall —</span> tested positive for a substance known as enobosarm. On June 23, 2019 Clemson did not release enobosarm investigation findings, citing privacy law. </p><p>In July 2019, National Football League player Taylor Lewan failed a drug test for Enobosarm, which Lewan claimed he ingested accidentally as an unlabeled ingredient in a supplement. </p><p>On October&#160;23, 2020, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) announced that the Italian rider Matteo Spreafico has been notified of two adverse analytical findings (AAFs) for Enobosarm in two samples collected during the Giro d'Italia on 15–16 October 2020. </p><p>On July&#160;6, 2021, during the 2020 Summer Olympics, Brazil women's national volleyball team player Tandara was temporarily suspended for testing positive for enobosarm. The test was carried out and identified by the Brazilian Doping Control Authority (ABDC). </p><p>On August&#160;12, 2021, after the 2020 Summer Olympics, Chijindu \"CJ\" Ujah, A member of the silver medal-winning British 4×100 relay team was temporarily suspended for testing positive for both enobosarm and S-23. The sample was collected post event by the International Testing Agency (ITA) and confirmed two days later as positive. The case was referred to the anti-doping division of the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Finally in February 2022, Great Britain were stripped of their silver medal. In October 2022, Ujah was suspended for 22 months by the ITA. </p><p>In October 2021, two Thoroughbred horses named Arafat and Komunist tested positive for enobosarm after races at Woodbine Racetrack. In a decision of the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario issued May 30, 2022, the horses were declared unplaced in the races in question, and their trainer Robert Gerl was fined $100,000 (as well as forfeiting prize money) and suspended from racing for 20 years. </p><p>In May 2022, National Football League Wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins was suspended six games without pay by the NFL for violating the league's performance-enhancing drug policy. According to Hopkins, he tested positive for enobosarm. </p><p>In April 2023, British boxer Amir Khan was banned for two years after an anti-doping test revealed the presence of enobosarm following his fight against Kell Brook in February 2022. </p><p>On May 1, 2024, American boxer Ryan Garcia tested positive for the performance-enhancing substance Ostarine the day before and the day of his upset win over Devin Haney last month, per a Voluntary Anti-Doping Association letter sent to all parties Wednesday and obtained by ESPN. The samples were taken prior to the fight, but the results weren't known until later. Garcia's A-sample also screened positive for 19-norandrosterone, but its presence is unconfirmed at this time. Garcia floored Haney three times during the majority decision victory, but that result could possibly be overturned because his B-sample tested positive on May 22, 2024. Garcia's fate now rests in the hands of the New York State Athletic Commission, which will adjudicate any suspensions and financial penalties. Sanctions also include the possibility of his win over Haney being overturned to a no-contest or having it changed to a disqualification. Despite his \"B\" samples returning positive results, Garcia has maintained his innocence and has cited substance contamination. </p> <p>Enobosarm is currently under development for the treatment of breast cancer. It was also previously under development for a variety of other potential uses, including treatment of cachexia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, muscle atrophy or sarcopenia, and stress incontinence. However, development for all other indications has been discontinued. </p><p>Enobosarm was assessed for the treatment of muscle wasting in people with lung cancer in two phase 3 clinical trials. The findings of these trials were reported in 2013. Enobosarm significantly improved lean body mass in the trials, but it was not effective in improving muscle strength, as measured by stair climb power. Consequent to these findings, enobosarm did not gain regulatory approval, and development for this use was terminated. Enobosarm had originally been under development for the treatment of sarcopenia (age-related muscle atrophy). However, the FDA requested a cardiovascular safety study be conducted to proceed with phase 3 trials for this indication. The developer of enobosarm refused to conduct this study due to the considerable costs that would be involved. Instead, it opted to trial enobosarm for muscle wasting in cachexia patients, in whom the FDA was more tolerant to cardiovascular side effects and did not require cardiovascular safety evaluation. </p><p>Following negative findings for muscle wasting, enobosarm was evaluated for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence in postmenopausal women. It was expected that enobosarm might be effective for this use by strengthening the pelvic floor muscles. Enobosarm reached phase 2 clinical trials for this indication, but development was discontinued due to lack of effectiveness in a phase 2 study. </p><p>Subsequently, enobosarm was repurposed again for the treatment of androgen receptor-positive (AR+) estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. As of November 2023, it is in phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of this type of breast cancer. Increases in lean body mass and muscle strength as a secondary benefit with enobosarm are also being evaluated in these women. These trials are notably employing several-fold higher doses of enobosarm than were assessed in the muscle wasting phase 3 trials (9&#160;mg/day versus 3&#160;mg/day, respectively). </p><p>In January 2024, it was announced that enobosarm was being developed for prevention of muscle wasting and augmentation of fat loss in combination with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists like semaglutide for weight loss. A phase 2b clinical trial for this indication with 3 to 6&#160;mg/day enobosarm in sarcopenic obese or overweight elderly individuals is being prepared. </p><p>According to GTx, the original developer of enobosarm, a total of 25 clinical studies have been carried out on more than 1,700 people involving doses from 1 to 100&#160;mg as of 2020.

Early on, GTx-024 appeared to have a very bright future as a treatment for sarcopenia/cachexia. Preliminary clinical trials demonstrated that GTx-024 could increase lean body mass and improve physical function without androgenic side effects (27). However, Enobosarm was dealt a blow after the phase III Prevention and treatment Of muscle Wasting in patients with cancER (POWER) I and II trials, where increases in lean body mass were once again observed, but without improved stair climb power (79,80). Failure to attain both primary endpoints led to a lack of approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has cast doubt on the previously charted course for SARMs and has tempered enthusiasm regarding the role of SARMs in the treatment of muscle wasting conditions.</q></cite></span> </li> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-1\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-2\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-3\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-4\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-5\"></a> <cite >Kim J, Wang R, Veverka KA, Dalton JT (November 2013). \"Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the novel SARM GTx-024 [(S)-N-(4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-3-(4-cyanophenoxy)-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanamide] in rats\". <i>Xenobiotica; the Fate of Foreign Compounds in Biological Systems</i>. <b>43</b> (11): 993–1009. doi:<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.3109%2F00498254.2013.788233\">10.3109/00498254.2013.788233</a>.

No study results were published; but GTx Incorporated reported that Ostarine failed to meet endpoints for improvement in lean body mass and physical function compared with placebo.</q></cite></span> </li> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Businesswire2013_13-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Businesswire2013_13-1\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Businesswire2013_13-2\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Businesswire2013_13-3\"></a> <cite><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130819005378/en/GTx-Reports-Results-for-Enobosarm-POWER-Trials-for-the-Prevention-and-Treatment-of-Muscle-Wasting-in-Patients-with-Non-Small-Cell-Lung-Cancer\">\"GTX Reports Results for Enobosarm POWER Trials for the Prevention and Treatment of Muscle Wasting in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\"</a> (Press release). 19 August 2013.</cite></span> </li> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid33672087_14-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid33672087_14-1\"></a> <cite >Tauchen J, Jurášek M, Huml L, Rimpelová S (February 2021). <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7919692\">\"Medicinal Use of Testosterone and Related Steroids Revisited\"</a>. <i>Molecules</i>. <b>26</b> (4): 1032. doi:<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fmolecules26041032\">10.3390/molecules26041032</a>.

This creates a new class of non-steroidal synthetic androgen, often termed Specific Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARM), a misleading marketing term rather than an accurate pharmacological description [113,114], usurping a speculative but unsound analogy with Specific Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERM). [...] none of the non-steroidal androgens under development [116,117] are marketed by 2021.

One randomized controlled trial , recruited male and females with cancer and weight loss showed that enobosarm 1 mg or 3 mg was associated with significant increase in lean body mass compared to placebo. This led to another ongoing trial, with more selection, aiming to evaluate enobosarm (with higher doses 9 or 18 mg) effect on physical function and lean body mass of ER+/AR+ breast cancer patients (NCT02463032). Such additional action of this class of drugs carries major hope for patients with AR-positive advanced breast cancer, where weight loss, muscle weakness and physical inactivity represent a big challenge for the patient's quality of life (QOL).</q></cite></span> </li> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid37946721_44-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid37946721_44-1\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid37946721_44-2\"></a> <cite >Hackbart H, Cui X, Lee JS (October 2023). <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10632549\">\"Androgen receptor in breast cancer and its clinical implication\"</a>. <i>Translational Breast Cancer Research</i>. <b>4</b>: 30. doi:<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.21037%2Ftbcr-23-44\">10.21037/tbcr-23-44</a>.

[...] these compounds have several properties in common: they are small, very lipophilic molecules with the potential to freely diffuse through cell membranes. Their receptors also share important features: in all animals, the receptors for steroid hormones are part of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-triggered transcription factors (Mangelsdorf et al. 1995). Unlike membrane receptors that trigger intracellular signalling pathways, these receptors work by influencing gene expression in the cell.</q></cite></span> </li> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid34218646_75-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid34218646_75-1\"></a> <cite >Yoon JH, Kwon KS (June 2021). <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8258343\">\"Receptor-Mediated Muscle Homeostasis as a Target for Sarcopenia Therapeutics\"</a>. <i>Endocrinology and Metabolism</i>. <b>36</b> (3): 478–490. doi:<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.3803%2FEnM.2021.1081\">10.3803/EnM.2021.1081</a>.

Ligands of intracellular receptors include lipophilic vitamins, steroid hormones, and small chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide, which require membrane permeability for intracellular delivery [30,31]. There are several barriers to the intracellular delivery of therapeutic drugs, such as lysosome degradation and active efflux out of the cell. Lowmolecular-weight lipophilic compounds can diffuse directly into cells, whereas high-molecular-weight compounds usually need membrane transporters or endocytosis [32,33]. Proper entry into the cell and subsequent contact with the exact target lead to better therapeutic effects and reduce undesirable adverse effects .</q></cite></span> </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid23881885_76-0\">^</a></b> <cite >Mohd Fauzi F, Koutsoukas A, Cunningham A, Gallegos A, Sedefov R, Bender A (July 2013). \"Computer-aided (in silico) approaches in the mode-of-action analysis and safety assessment of ostarine and 4-methylamphetamine\". <i>Human Psychopharmacology</i>. <b>28</b> (4): 365–378. doi:<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002%2Fhup.2322\">10.1002/hup.2322</a>.

It was also under development for a variety of other indications, including treatment of [cachexia](/wiki/Cachexia), [Duchenne muscular dystrophy](/wiki/Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy), [muscle atrophy](/wiki/Muscle_atrophy) or [sarcopenia](/wiki/Sarcopenia), and [stress urinary incontinence](/wiki/Stress_incontinence), but development for all other uses has been discontinued.[[1]](#cite_note-AdisInsight-1)[[10]](#cite_note-pmid32476495-10)[[2]](#cite_note-pmid32257854-2) Enobosarm was evaluated for the treatment of [muscle wasting](/wiki/Muscle_wasting) related to [cancer](/wiki/Cancer) in [late-stage](/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_III) [clinical trials](/wiki/Clinical_trial), and the drug improved [lean body mass](/wiki/Lean_body_mass) in

[fatigue](/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)), [anemia](/wiki/Anemia), [nausea](/wiki/Nausea), [diarrhea](/wiki/Diarrhea), [back pain](/wiki/Back_pain), adverse [lipid](/wiki/Lipid) changes like decreased [high-density lipoprotein](/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein) (HDL) [cholesterol](/wiki/Cholesterol) levels, changes in [sex hormone](/wiki/Sex_hormone) concentrations like decreased

[masculinizing](/wiki/Virilization) effects of enobosarm, for instance in women, have largely not been evaluated and are unknown.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17) The potential [adverse effects](/wiki/Adverse_effect) and risks of high doses of enobosarm are also unknown.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17) Enobosarm is a [nonsteroidal](/wiki/Nonsteroidal) SARM, acting as an [agonist](/wiki/Agonist) of the [androgen receptor](/wiki/Androgen_receptor) (AR), the [biological target](/wiki/Biological_target) of [androgens](/wiki/Androgen) and [anabolic steroids](/wiki/Anabolic_steroid) like [testosterone](/wiki/Testosterone_(medication)) and [dihydrotestosterone](/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone) (DHT).[[10]](#cite_note-pmid32476495-10) However, it shows dissociation of effect between tissues in [preclinical studies](/wiki/Preclinical_research), with agonistic and [anabolic](/wiki/Anabolic) effects in muscle and bone, agonistic effects in [breast](/wiki/Breast), and [partially agonistic](/wiki/Partial_agonist) or [antagonistic](/wiki/Receptor_antagonist) effects in the [prostate gland](/wiki/Prostate_gland) and [seminal

The AR-mediated effects of enobosarm in many other androgen-sensitive tissues are unknown.[[18]](#cite_note-MohlerNair2005-18)[[20]](#cite_note-pmid25905231-20)\nEnobosarm was first identified in 2004[[11]](#cite_note-pmid27535042-11) and has been under clinical development since at least 2005.[[1]](#cite_note-AdisInsight-1)[[18]](#cite_note-MohlerNair2005-18) It is the most well-studied SARM of all of the agents that have been developed.[[21]](#cite_note-ZajacSeeman2020-21) According to GTx, its developer, a total of 25 clinical studies have been carried out on more than 1,700 people involving doses from 1 to 100&#160;mg as of 2020.[[10]](#cite_note-pmid32476495-10)[[22]](#cite_note-Biospace2016-22) However, enobosarm has not yet completed clinical development or been approved for any use.[[1]](#cite_note-AdisInsight-1)[[2]](#cite_note-pmid32257854-2) As of November 2023, it is in [phase 3](/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_III) [clinical trials](/wiki/Clinical_trial) for the treatment of breast cancer and is in [phase 2](/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_II) studies for improvement of body composition in people taking GLP-1 receptor agonists.[[1]](#cite_note-AdisInsight-1)[[9]](#cite_note-Biospace2024-9) Enobosarm was developed by [GTx, Inc.](/wiki/GTx_Incorporated), and is now being developed by Veru, Inc.[[1]](#cite_note-AdisInsight-1)\nAside from its development as a potential [pharmaceutical drug](/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug), enobosarm is on the [World Anti-Doping Agency](/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency) [list of prohibited substances](/wiki/List_of_drugs_banned_by_the_World_Anti-Doping_Agency) and is sold for [physique- and

young male gym users reported using SARMs.[[23]](#cite_note-pmid38059982-23) In addition, a London [wastewater analysis](/wiki/Wastewater_surveillance) found that enobosarm was the most abundant \"pharmaceutical drug\" detected and was more prevalent than \"classical\" [recreational drugs](/wiki/Recreational_drug) like [MDMA](/wiki/MDMA) and [cocaine](/wiki/Cocaine).[[24]](#cite_note-TheGuardian2018-24) Enobosarm is often used in these contexts at doses greatly exceeding those evaluated in clinical trials, with unknown effectiveness and [safety](/wiki/Drug_safety).[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17) Many products sold online that are purported to be enobosarm either contain none or contain other unrelated substances.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[25]](#cite_note-pmid29183075-25) [Social media](/wiki/Social_media) has played an important role in facilitating the widespread non-medical use of SARMs.[[26]](#cite_note-pmid35574698-26)\n\nEnobosarm is not approved for any medical use and is not available as a licensed [pharmaceutical drug](/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug) as of

have ranged from 0.6% to 33% in these trials.[[12]](#cite_note-pmid36479151-12)[[16]](#cite_note-pmid26401842-16) Liver enzyme elevations with enobosarm are often transient and resolve spontaneously.[[12]](#cite_note-pmid36479151-12) However, markedly elevated liver enzymes have occasionally occurred with enobosarm in clinical trials and have necessitated [discontinuation](/wiki/Drug_discontinuation).[[12]](#cite_note-pmid36479151-12) There have been several published [case reports](/wiki/Case_report) of [hepatotoxicity](/wiki/Hepatotoxicity) with

Between 2020 and 2022, there has been a rapid increase in reported cases of liver toxicity with SARMs.[[32]](#cite_note-pmid37218811-32) The hepatotoxicity with SARMs may be related to their resistance to [hepatic](/wiki/Liver) [metabolism](/wiki/Metabolism), analogously to the case of [17α-alkylated anabolic steroids](/wiki/17%CE%B1-alkylated_anabolic_steroid).[[12]](#cite_note-pmid36479151-12)\nSARMs are often advertised and sold on the Internet at doses higher than have been described in the literature.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[27]](#cite_note-pmid37571268-27) Sometimes doses are recommended as several-fold or more greater than the doses used in clinical trials, or seemingly arbitrary doses are advised.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[27]](#cite_note-pmid37571268-27) For instance, enobosarm has been provided at doses of greater than or equal to 20&#160;mg per serving and recommended by bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts at doses of 10 to 30&#160;mg/day, relative to the most widely assessed highest dose in clinical trials of 3&#160;mg/day—an up to 10-fold difference.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[27]](#cite_note-pmid37571268-27) SARMs, particularly when used at high or excessive doses for prolonged periods of time, may result in substantial suppression of [endogenous](/wiki/Endogenous) [sex hormones](/wiki/Sex_hormone) like [testosterone](/wiki/Testosterone) and [estradiol](/wiki/Estradiol), in turn producing widespread unintended deleterious effects on physiological function.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17) As examples, SARMs may produce potent anabolic effects with deficiency in important androgenic effects, may result in [estrogen deficiency](/wiki/Estrogen_deficiency) with consequences like [bone loss](/wiki/Osteoporosis) among others, and, due to suppression of the [hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis](/wiki/Hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary%E2%80%93gonadal_axis) (HPG axis), may cause [infertility](/wiki/Infertility).[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)\n[Androgens](/wiki/Androgen) and [anabolic

and [liver damage](/wiki/Liver_damage) and has warned against their use in [bodybuilding](/wiki/Bodybuilding) products.[[41]](#cite_note-FDA2017-41)\n\nEnobosarm has been assessed in clinical trials at doses ranging from 0.1 to 18&#160;mg/day.[[10]](#cite_note-pmid32476495-10) However, most research has been done at doses of 0.1 to 3&#160;mg/day, with two [phase

metabolism.[[4]](#cite_note-pmid27105861-4) Since enobosarm is metabolized by CYP3A4, UGT1A1, and UGT2B7, [inhibitors](/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor) and [inducers](/wiki/Enzyme_inducer) of these enzymes can modify the metabolism and [pharmacokinetics](/wiki/Pharmacokinetics) of enobosarm.[[4]](#cite_note-pmid27105861-4) The strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [itraconazole](/wiki/Itraconazole) was shown to have minimal to no influence on the pharmacokinetics of enobosarm, whereas the strong CYP3A4 inducer [rifampin](/wiki/Rifampin) reduced enobosarm [peak](/wiki/Cmax_(pharmacology)) levels by 23%, [elimination half-life](/wiki/Elimination_half-life) by 23%, and [area-under-the-curve levels](/wiki/Area-under-the-curve_levels) by 43%.[[46]](#cite_note-pmid27885819-46)[[4]](#cite_note-pmid27105861-4) The pan-UGT inhibitor [probenecid](/wiki/Probenecid) was shown to not affect peak levels of enobosarm but to increase the

somewhat lower [potency](/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)) than DHT in terms of activating the receptor.[[7]](#cite_note-JonesCossSteinerDalton2013-7) In addition to general activation of the AR, enobosarm induces the N/C interaction (the interaction of the [amino terminus](/wiki/Amino_terminus) and [carboxyl terminus](/wiki/Carboxyl_terminus)) of the AR less potently than does DHT, but in any case promotes the N/C interaction concentration-dependently and to the same maximal extent as DHT.[[49]](#cite_note-pmid20444881-49) The AR is widely expressed in [tissues](/wiki/Tissue_(biology))

unknown.[[51]](#cite_note-pmid28624515-51)[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17) However, recruitment of both [coactivators](/wiki/Coactivator_(genetics)) and [corepressors](/wiki/Corepressor) instead of only coactivators and resultant differing [receptor conformations](/wiki/Protein_conformation), distinct tissue-specific modulation of [signaling pathways](/wiki/Signaling_cascade) mediating [genomic](/wiki/Nuclear_receptor) and [non-genomic](/wiki/Membrane_steroid_receptor) effects, and differences in within-tissue [ligand](/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)) [metabolism](/wiki/Metabolism) and

coactivators to corepressors vary in different tissues throughout the body, and it is thought that SARMs may have agonistic effects in tissues with an excess of coactivators relative to corepressors like muscle and bone and may have partially agonistic or antagonistic effects in tissues with an excess of corepressors over coactivators like the prostate.[[51]](#cite_note-pmid28624515-51) Another mechanism may be that SARMs like enobosarm induce the N/C interaction less readily than AR full agonists like DHT.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[47]](#cite_note-pmid23231475-47)[[53]](#cite_note-pmid19357508-53)[[49]](#cite_note-pmid20444881-49) Induction of the N/C interaction has been associated with

In one of the first published studies, enobosarm maximally restored prostate weight to 51%, seminal vesicle weight to 98%, and levator ani muscle weight to 136% in castrated male rats relative to gonadally intact control male rats, with an [ED50](/wiki/Effective_dose_(pharmacology)) dose for muscle of 0.03&#160;mg/day.[[56]](#cite_note-pmid24189892-56)[[51]](#cite_note-pmid28624515-51)[[48]](#cite_note-pmid15987833-48) For comparison, [testosterone propionate](/wiki/Testosterone_propionate) was able to maximally stimulate levator ani muscle to 104% and prostate weight to 121%, with ED50 doses of 0.15&#160;mg/day and 0.13&#160;mg/day, respectively.[[7]](#cite_note-JonesCossSteinerDalton2013-7) Hence, enobosarm was able to stimulate the levator ani muscle to a size greater than that in normal male rats or produced with exogenous testosterone in castrated male rats, but was only capable of partially rescuing prostate gland weight.[[51]](#cite_note-pmid28624515-51)[[48]](#cite_note-pmid15987833-48)[[7]](#cite_note-JonesCossSteinerDalton2013-7) Additionally, enobosarm fully maintained or restored levator ani weight at doses that did not affect LH or FSH levels in gonadally intact animals (≤0.1&#160;mg/day).[[7]](#cite_note-JonesCossSteinerDalton2013-7) As such, it was more potent in stimulating muscle than testosterone at doses that did not affect [gonadotropin](/wiki/Gonadotropin) levels.[[5]](#cite_note-pmid24490605-5)[[7]](#cite_note-JonesCossSteinerDalton2013-7) In gonadally intact male rats, enobosarm significantly increased levator ani muscle weight to 131% of intact controls but significantly decreased the weights of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles, demonstrating an antagonistic or partially agonistic effect in these tissues.[[7]](#cite_note-JonesCossSteinerDalton2013-7) In another animal study, enobosarm and DHT increased levator ani weights to similar or slightly different extents in intact male rats, but DHT strongly increased prostate weight while enobosarm reduced prostate

completely maintain bone quality and composition in castrated male rats and to partially but not fully prevent bone loss in ovariectomized female rats, indicating potent anabolic effects in bone as well.[[7]](#cite_note-JonesCossSteinerDalton2013-7)\nIn a [phase 2](/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_II) human clinical trial in healthy elderly men and postmenopausal women, enobosarm dose-dependently increased [lean body mass](/wiki/Lean_body_mass) (muscle mass) across doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3&#160;mg/day, with a significant 1.3&#160;kg gain over placebo at 3&#160;mg/day and a non-significant 0.7&#160;kg gain over placebo at 1&#160;mg/day.[[10]](#cite_note-pmid32476495-10)[[28]](#cite_note-pmid22031847-28) Similarly, in two [phase 3](/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_III) clinical trials in men and postmenopausal women with muscle wasting due to [non-small-cell lung cancer](/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_cancer), enobosarm at 3&#160;mg/day significantly increased lean body mass by 0.41&#160;kg and 0.47&#160;kg.[[10]](#cite_note-pmid32476495-10) However, enobosarm did not successfully increase muscle strength in these phase 3 trials.[[10]](#cite_note-pmid32476495-10) In any case, it has been suggested that the [study designs](/wiki/Clinical_study_design) and physical function outcomes in such trials may have been flawed.[[60]](#cite_note-pmid28807233-60)[[61]](#cite_note-pmid33759397-61)[[62]](#cite_note-pmid30138131-62)[[63]](#cite_note-pmid36866171-63)[[2]](#cite_note-pmid32257854-2) The increases in lean body mass that have been seen with employed doses of enobosarm in clinical trials are very modest compared to those produced with supraphysiological doses of testosterone over similar timeframes (e.g., 0.5–1.5&#160;kg with enobosarm versus 5–8&#160;kg with 300–600&#160;mg/week intramuscular testosterone enanthate in healthy young men).[[53]](#cite_note-pmid19357508-53)[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[64]](#cite_note-pmid11701431-64) The effects of higher doses of enobosarm (9–18&#160;mg/day) on lean body mass and muscle strength are also being evaluated in women with breast cancer.[[2]](#cite_note-pmid32257854-2)[[43]](#cite_note-KassemShohdy2019-43) There is some evidence that women may be more sensitive to lean body mass increases with SARMs, specifically [GSK-2881078](/wiki/GSK2881078) but potentially also others like enobosarm, than men.[[10]](#cite_note-pmid32476495-10)[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)\nIn addition to its mixed agonist–antagonist activity at the AR, enobosarm is likely to also differ from steroidal androgens in its effects due to differences in within-tissue ligand metabolism.[[37]](#cite_note-pmid18500378-37)[[31]](#cite_note-pmid24945109-31)[[18]](#cite_note-MohlerNair2005-18)[[52]](#cite_note-pmid17339601-52) The [virilizing](/wiki/Virilization) and androgenic effects of the traditional steroidal androgens like testosterone in [skin](/wiki/Skin), [hair follicles](/wiki/Hair_follicle), and the [prostate gland](/wiki/Prostate_gland) are attributed to high [expression](/wiki/Gene_expression) of [5α-reductase](/wiki/5%CE%B1-reductase) in these tissues and consequent local conversion and potentiation into more [potent](/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)) androgens.[[37]](#cite_note-pmid18500378-37)[[31]](#cite_note-pmid24945109-31)[[18]](#cite_note-MohlerNair2005-18) In the case of testosterone, this is via conversion into the 10-fold more potent androgen DHT.[[31]](#cite_note-pmid24945109-31)[[18]](#cite_note-MohlerNair2005-18) Enobosarm is not subject to this local transformation and potentiation, and so is theorized to have greatly reduced effects in these tissues relative to testosterone and certain other steroidal androgens.[[31]](#cite_note-pmid24945109-31)[[18]](#cite_note-MohlerNair2005-18)[[20]](#cite_note-pmid25905231-20) This is likewise theorized to be the case for non-5α-reductase-potentiated anabolic steroids like nandrolone and oxandrolone, which have high [myotrophic–androgenic potency ratios](/wiki/Anabolic_steroid#Pharmacology) in animals.[[37]](#cite_note-pmid18500378-37) The lack of 5α-reduction may result in reduced androgenic side effects like [scalp hair loss](/wiki/Scalp_hair_loss), [facial and body hair growth](/wiki/Hirsutism), and [prostate growth](/wiki/Prostatism).[[20]](#cite_note-pmid25905231-20)[[65]](#cite_note-pmid27141449-65)[[11]](#cite_note-pmid27535042-11) On the other hand, although SARMs, like enobosarm, as well as anabolic steroids, may have reduced virilizing effects in skin and hair follicles, this is not necessarily the case for virilization in general.[[37]](#cite_note-pmid18500378-37)[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17) In particular, the muscle-promoting effects of these agents can be considered a masculinizing effect.[[16]](#cite_note-pmid26401842-16)[[66]](#cite_note-pmid36644692-66) The potential masculinizing effects of enobosarm and SARMs in general are largely uncharacterized and unknown.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17) Aside from metabolism differences related to 5α-reduction, enobosarm has also shown much greater impact in the [liver](/wiki/Liver), specifically on certain aspects of [hepatic protein synthesis](/wiki/Liver_protein_synthesis) like reduction of [sex hormone-binding globulin](/wiki/Sex_hormone-binding_globulin) (SHBG) production, than even highly

Unfortunately, results of recent clinical trials of the SARM GTx-024 (Enobosarm) have tempered expectations for its utility as a therapy for muscle wasting. Early on, GTx-024 appeared to have a very bright future as a treatment for sarcopenia/cachexia. Preliminary clinical trials demonstrated that GTx-024 could increase lean body mass and improve physical function without androgenic side effects (27). However, Enobosarm was dealt a blow after the phase III Prevention and treatment Of muscle Wasting in patients with cancER (POWER) I and II trials, where increases in lean body mass were once again observed, but without improved stair climb power (79,80). Failure to attain both primary endpoints led to a lack of approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has cast doubt on the previously charted course for SARMs and has tempered enthusiasm regarding the role of SARMs in the treatment of muscle wasting conditions.\n\n^ [***a***](#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-1) [***c***](#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-2) [***d***](#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-3) [***e***](#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-4) [***f***](#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-5) Kim J, Wang R, Veverka KA, Dalton JT (November 2013). \"Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the novel SARM GTx-024 [(S)-N-(4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-3-(4-cyanophenoxy)-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanamide] in rats\". *Xenobiotica; the Fate of Foreign Compounds in Biological Systems*. **43** (11): 993–1009.

[...] to proceed with enobosarm into a phase III clinical trial in patients with sarcopenia, the FDA requested a cardiovascular safety study, which the manufacturer refused to undertake due to considerable costs and decided to test enobosarm in cancer cachexia patients in whom the FDA was more tolerant to the long-term cardiovascular side effects [67]. [...] Enobosarm promotes a similar anabolic response compared with DHT via muscle AR activation, [...] [35]. In a recent study with ovariectomized mice, the weight of the musculus gastrocnemius has been shown to be higher in all groups treated with ostarine as well as bone mineral density and bone biomechanical properties [15]. Moreover, the stimulation of reproductive organs with enobosarm seems to be less pronounced compared to testosterone administration [36] due to its partial agonist and antagonist effect on other androgen-dependent tissues such as prostate and seminal vesicles [37]. [...] In the POWER trials (POWER 1, NCT01355484 and POWER 2, NCT01355497; Table 1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, and multi-center phase III studies [40], patients with non-small-cell lung cancer were given 3 mg of enobosarm or placebo for five months. Despite a lower rate of decline in body weight in the group treated with enobosarm in POWER 1, patients increased LBM at day 84 and day 147 in POWER 1 (+0.41 kg) and POWER 2 (+0.47 kg) compared with patients receiving placebo.

However, reduced liver clearance increases the potential for hepatotoxicity.19 Much like this class of AASs, SARMs have been designed for adequate oral bioavailability with decreased liver degradation which would likely create a similar potential for hepatotoxicity.8,15 [...] Ostarine was the first SARM to undergo a phase III clinical trial. The POWER1 and POWER2 trials were two identical randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate the efficacy of Ostarine for the treatment of muscle wasting in non-small cell lung cancer.

Selective AR modulators (SARMs) are a class of drugs in development; unlike androgen synthesis inhibitors, they act as selective androgen agonists and show promise as a potential therapeutic strategy in BCa. Enobosarm (GTx024) is the farthest along in clinical development, and demonstrates an agonist effect that in some populations inhibits BCa growth. Preclinical data show antitumor activity of GTx-024 in ARC stably expressing cell lines MCF-7 (ERC) and MDA-MB-231 (TNBC) implanted subcutaneously into nude mice. Tumor growth was reduced more than 75% in MDA-MB-231-AR cells and 50% in MCF-7-AR cells compared with vehicle-treated tumors, demonstrating benefit (Dalton et al. 2013).\n\n^ [***a***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-1) [***c***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-2) [***d***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-3) [***e***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-4) [***f***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-5) [***g***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-6) [***h***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-7) [***i***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-8) [***j***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-9) [***k***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-10) Feingold KR, Anawalt B, Blackman MR, Boyce A, Chrousos G, Corpas E, et&#160;al.

This creates a new class of non-steroidal synthetic androgen, often termed Specific Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARM), a misleading marketing term rather than an accurate pharmacological description [113,114], usurping a speculative but unsound analogy with Specific Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERM). [...] none of the non-steroidal androgens under development [116,117] are marketed by 2021. Yet hope springs eternal for this new attempt to separate anabolic from androgenic properties of androgens to facilitate marketing for muscle wasting and other selective effects of testosterone.\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-pmid21511988_40-0)** Handelsman DJ (May 2011). \"Commentary: androgens and \"anabolic steroids\": the one-headed janus\". *Endocrinology*. **152** (5): 1752–1754.

Although development of the first nonsteroidal androgens (17, 18) as candidate selective AR modulators (19) raises hope of resurrecting this defunct term (20), prereceptor activation mechanisms cannot apply to nonsteroidal androgens, and the singular AR lacks a dual drive mechanism of the other paired sex steroid receptors. Consequently, it is not surprising that available knowledge (21) provides only slender hope that this failed, and probably false, dichotomy will now succeed through a renewed search guided by the same in vivo bioassay.\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-FDA2017_41-0)** [\"FDA In Brief: FDA warns against using SARMs in body-building products\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20190803085240/https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-brief/fda-brief-fda-warns-against-using-sarms-body-building-products).

It is worth noting that SARMs were initially developed to get benefit of their anabolic effect on muscle and bone without much harm to other tissues. One randomized controlled trial [28], recruited male and females with cancer and weight loss showed that enobosarm 1 mg or 3 mg was associated with significant increase in lean body mass compared to placebo. This led to another ongoing trial, with more selection, aiming to evaluate enobosarm (with higher doses 9 or 18 mg) effect on physical function and lean body mass of ER+/AR+ breast cancer patients (NCT02463032). Such additional action of this class of drugs carries major hope for patients with AR-positive advanced breast cancer, where weight loss, muscle weakness and physical inactivity represent a big challenge for the patient's quality of life (QOL).\n\n^ [***a***](#cite_ref-pmid37946721_44-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-pmid37946721_44-1) [***c***](#cite_ref-pmid37946721_44-2) Hackbart H, Cui X, Lee JS (October 2023).

At the doses that have been tested, the first generation SARMs induce modest gains in lean body mass in healthy volunteers, which are nowhere near the much greater gains in skeletal muscle mass reported with supraphysiological doses of testosterone. The modest gains of 1.0 to 1.5 kg in fat-free mass with first generation SARMs over 4–6 weeks should be contrasted with the 5–7 kg gains in fat-free mass with 300 and 600 mg doses of testosterone enanthate. However, it is possible that next generation of SARM molecules will have greater potency and selectivity than the first generation SARMs.\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-HohlMarcelli2023_54-0)** Hohl A, Marcelli M (2023).

Enobosarm was discovered in 2004 as a hyper-myoanabolic SARM that dissociated the anabolic from androgenic effects of AR in terms of potency (ED50) and efficacy (Emax) [29]. Levator ani muscle weight was increased to 131 and 136% of intact controls in intact and castrated (maintenance mode) rats, respectively, without significant increases in ventral prostate and seminal vesicles weights. Importantly, increases in levator ani muscle weight were associated with increases in muscle strength (soleus) in rats. Enobosarm also exerted in-vivo osteoanabolic effects alone and synergistically with alendronate in terms of bone density, strength, and structure [30], which was explained by in-vitro mechanistic studies that demonstrated antiresorptive (osteoclast inhibition) and anabolic (osteoblast differentiation) effects [31].\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-pmid26393303_57-0)** Dubois V, Simitsidellis I, Laurent MR, Jardi F, Saunders PT, Vanderschueren D, et&#160;al.

Liver effects could also be diminished by using routes of administration other than oral. First pass effects would be avoided. [...] Although this discussion has focused predominantly on contraceptives, similar principles seem applicable for diminishing the liver side-effects of androgenic preparations. Thus, androgens should be selected which are likely to be metabolized on entering the hepatocyte and a parenteral route of administration may be preferable. Androgens which are not 17 alkylated might produce fewer liver side-effects than 17 alkylated derivatives judging from their relative effects on plasma protein levels [Z].\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-pmid3320549_71-0)** Lax ER (1987). \"Mechanisms of physiological and pharmacological sex hormone action on the mammalian liver\". *Journal of Steroid Biochemistry*. **27** (4–6): 1119–1128.

Androgen and oestrogen receptors have been demonstrated in mammalian liver, but since it is generally accepted that they are probably non-functional at endogenous steroid concentrations, it is not apparent how they mediate physiological influences on this organ. Nor is it certain to what extent pharmacological actions of sex hormones reflect overstimulation of physiological routes or whether alternative mechanisms become available once threshold values have been reached. [...] Many of the dangers inherent in synthetic androgen or anabolic steroid therapy may be due less to the androgenic characteristics than to the structural modifications performed to prevent [hepatic] inactivation (e.g. insertion of an acetylene group at 17α).\n\n^ [***a***](#cite_ref-PubChem-Enobosarm_72-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-PubChem-Enobosarm_72-1) [\"Enobosarm\"](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Enobosarm). *PubChem*.

Both male (androgens) and female (oestrogens, progestins) sex hormones are steroid hormones. [...] these compounds have several properties in common: they are small, very lipophilic molecules with the potential to freely diffuse through cell membranes. Their receptors also share important features: in all animals, the receptors for steroid hormones are part of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-triggered transcription factors (Mangelsdorf et al. 1995). Unlike membrane receptors that trigger intracellular signalling pathways, these receptors work by influencing gene expression in the cell.\n\n^ [***a***](#cite_ref-pmid34218646_75-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-pmid34218646_75-1) Yoon JH, Kwon KS (June 2021).

[PMID](/wiki/PMID_(identifier))&#160;[34218646](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34218646). Intracellular receptors account for 10% to 15% of drugs on the market, including drugs that act on cytoplasmic receptors such as androgen receptors (ARs), estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and glucocorticoid receptors, and other drugs that act on nuclear receptors such as vitamin D receptor (VDR), thyroid hormone receptors, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors [27-30]. Ligands of intracellular receptors include lipophilic vitamins, steroid hormones, and small chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide, which require membrane permeability for intracellular delivery [30,31]. There are several barriers to the intracellular delivery of therapeutic drugs, such as lysosome degradation and active efflux out of the cell. Lowmolecular-weight lipophilic compounds can diffuse directly into cells, whereas high-molecular-weight compounds usually need membrane transporters or endocytosis [32,33]. Proper entry into the cell and subsequent contact with the exact target lead to better therapeutic effects and reduce undesirable adverse effects [34].\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-pmid23881885_76-0)** Mohd Fauzi F, Koutsoukas A, Cunningham A, Gallegos A, Sedefov R, Bender A (July 2013). \"Computer-aided (in silico) approaches in the mode-of-action analysis and safety assessment of ostarine and 4-methylamphetamine\". *Human Psychopharmacology*. **28** (4): 365–378.

Effective medical management of these diseases is an unmet need. The steroid hormones progesterone (P4), estrogen (E2), and testosterone play a major role in reproductive physiology and uterine pathologies. Notably, selective progesterone receptor modulators have shown considerable promise as treatment options for some hormone-dependent conditions. More limited data are available regarding the safety and efficacy of selective androgen receptor modulators. In this report we review current evidence for selective progesterone receptor modulators and selective androgen receptor modulators as treatment options for benign gynecologic conditions.",

is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and sympathomimetic agent that is often used to prevent low blood pressure during anesthesia. It has also been used for asthma, narcolepsy, and obesity but is not the preferred treatment. It is of unclear benefit in nasal congestion. It can be taken by mouth or by injection into a muscle, vein, or just under the skin. Onset with intravenous use is fast, while injection into a muscle can take 20&#160;minutes, and by mouth can take an hour for effect. When given by injection, it lasts about an hour, and when taken by mouth, it can last up to four hours. </p><p>Common side effects include trouble sleeping, anxiety, headache, hallucinations, high blood pressure, fast heart rate, loss of appetite, and urinary retention. Serious side effects include stroke and heart attack. While probably safe in pregnancy, its use in this population is poorly studied. Use during breastfeeding is not recommended. Ephedrine works by inducing the release of norepinephrine and hence indirectly activating the α- and β-adrenergic receptors. Chemically, ephedrine is a substituted amphetamine and is the (1<i>R</i>,2<i>S</i>)-enantiomer of <a href=\"/wiki/Hydroxymethylamphetamine\" title=\"Hydroxymethylamphetamine\">β-hydroxy-<i>N</i>-methylamphetamine</a>. </p><p>Ephedrine was first isolated in 1885 and came into commercial use in 1926. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. It can normally be found in plants of the <i>Ephedra</i> genus. Over-the-counter dietary supplements containing ephedrine are illegal in the United States, with the exception of those used in traditional Chinese medicine, where its presence is noted by <a href=\"/wiki/Ephedra_(plant)\" title=\"Ephedra (plant)\"><i>má huáng</i></a>. </p> <meta property=\"mw:PageProp/toc\"> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:EphedrineInBottles.jpg\"><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/EphedrineInBottles.jpg/250px-EphedrineInBottles.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"250\" height=\"275\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/EphedrineInBottles.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"363\" data-file-height=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Ephedrine Sulphate (1932), Ephedrine Compound (1932), and Swan-Myers Ephedrine Inhalant No. 66 (<i>circa</i> 1940).</figcaption></figure> <p>Ephedrine is a non-catecholamine sympathomimetic with cardiovascular effects similar to those of adrenaline (epinephrine): increased blood pressure, heart rate, and contractility. Like pseudoephedrine, it is a bronchodilator, with pseudoephedrine having considerably less effect. </p><p>Ephedrine may decrease motion sickness, but it has mainly been used to decrease the sedating effects of other medications used for motion sickness. </p><p>Ephedrine is also found to have quick and long-lasting responsiveness in congenital myasthenic syndrome in early childhood and also even in adults with a novel COLQ mutation. </p><p>Ephedrine is administered by intravenous boluses. Redosing usually requires increased doses to offset the development of tachyphylaxis, which is attributed to the depletion of catecholamine stores. </p> <p>Ephedrine promotes modest short-term weight loss, specifically fat loss, but its long-term effects are unknown. In mice, ephedrine is known to stimulate thermogenesis in the brown adipose tissue, but because adult humans have only small amounts of brown fat, thermogenesis is assumed to take place mostly in the skeletal muscle. Ephedrine also decreases gastric emptying. Methylxanthines such as caffeine and theophylline have a synergistic effect with ephedrine for weight loss. This led to the creation and marketing of compound products. One of them, known as the ECA stack, contains ephedrine with caffeine and aspirin. It is a popular supplement taken by bodybuilders seeking to cut body fat before a competition. A 2021 systematic review found that ephedrine taken in doses from 60 mg to 150mg, with or without caffeine, for 4 to 24 weeks led to a 2 kilograms (4.4&#160;lb) weight loss greater than placebo, raised heart rate, and reduced LDL and raised HDL, with no statistically significant difference in blood pressure. </p> <p>Ephedrine is available as a prescription-only pharmaceutical drug in the form of an intravenous solution, under brand names including Akovaz, Corphedra, Emerphed, and Rezipres as well as in generic forms, in the United States. It is also available over-the-counter in the form of 12.5 and 25&#160;mg oral tablets for use as a bronchodilator and as a 0.5% concentration nasal spray for use as a decongestant. The drug is additionally available in combination with guaifenesin in the form of oral tablets and liquids. Ephedrine is provided as the hydrochloride or sulfate salt in pharmaceutical formulations. </p> <p>Ephedrine should not be used in conjunction with certain antidepressants, namely norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), as this increases the risk of symptoms due to excessive serum levels of norepinephrine. </p><p>Bupropion is an example of an antidepressant with an amphetamine-like structure similar to ephedrine, and it is an NDRI. Its action bears more resemblance to amphetamine than to fluoxetine in that its primary mode of therapeutic action involves norepinephrine and to a lesser degree dopamine, but it also releases some serotonin from presynaptic clefts. It should not be used with ephedrine, as it may increase the likelihood of side effects. </p><p>Ephedrine should be used with caution in patients with inadequate fluid replacement, impaired adrenal function, hypoxia, hypercapnia, acidosis, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, prostatic hypertrophy, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, during delivery if maternal blood pressure is &gt;130/80 mmHg, and during lactation. </p><p>Contraindications for the use of ephedrine include: closed-angle glaucoma, phaeochromocytoma, asymmetric septal hypertrophy (idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis), concomitant or recent (previous 14 days) monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) therapy, general anesthesia with halogenated hydrocarbons (particularly halothane), tachyarrhythmias or ventricular fibrillation, or hypersensitivity to ephedrine or other stimulants. </p><p>Ephedrine should not be used at any time during pregnancy unless specifically indicated by a qualified physician and only when other options are unavailable. </p> <p>Ephedrine is a potentially dangerous natural compound; as of 2004 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had received over 18,000 reports of adverse effects in people using it. </p><p>Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are more common with systemic administration (e.g. injection or oral administration) compared to topical administration (e.g. nasal instillations). ADRs associated with ephedrine therapy include </p> <ul><li>Cardiovascular: tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, angina pectoris, vasoconstriction with hypertension</li> <li>Dermatological: flushing, sweating, acne vulgaris</li> <li>Gastrointestinal: nausea</li> <li>Genitourinary: decreased urination due to vasoconstriction of renal arteries, difficulty urinating is not uncommon, as alpha-agonists such as ephedrine constrict the internal urethral sphincter, mimicking the effects of sympathetic nervous system stimulation</li> <li>Nervous system: restlessness, confusion, insomnia, mild euphoria, mania/hallucinations (rare except in previously existing psychiatric conditions), delusions, formication (may be possible, but lacks documented evidence) paranoia, hostility, panic, agitation</li> <li>Respiratory: dyspnea, pulmonary edema</li> <li>Miscellaneous: dizziness, headache, tremor, hyperglycemic reactions, dry mouth</li></ul> <p>Overdose of ephedrine may result in sympathomimetic symptoms like tachycardia and hypertension. </p> <p>Ephedrine with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) like phenelzine and tranylcypromine can result in hypertensive crisis. </p> <table> <caption>Monoamine release by ephedrine and related agents (<a href=\"/wiki/Half_maximal_effective_concentration\" title=\"Half maximal effective concentration\"><abbr title=\"half maximal effective concentration\">EC<sub>50</sub></abbr></a>Tooltip half maximal effective concentration, nM) </caption> <tbody><tr> <th>Compound</th> <th data-sort-type=\"number\"><a href=\"/wiki/Norepinephrine\" title=\"Norepinephrine\"><abbr title=\"Norepinephrine\">NE</abbr></a>Tooltip Norepinephrine</th> <th data-sort-type=\"number\"><a href=\"/wiki/Dopamine\" title=\"Dopamine\"><abbr title=\"Dopamine\">DA</abbr></a>Tooltip Dopamine</th> <th data-sort-type=\"number\"><a href=\"/wiki/Serotonin\" title=\"Serotonin\"><abbr title=\"Serotonin\">5-HT</abbr></a>Tooltip Serotonin</th> <th>Ref </th></tr> <tr> <td>Dextroamphetamine (<i>S</i>(+)-amphetamine)</td> <td>6.6–7.2</td> <td>5.8–24.8</td> <td>698–1765</td> <td> </td></tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"/wiki/Cathinone\" title=\"Cathinone\"><i>S</i>(–)-Cathinone</a></td> <td>12.4</td> <td>18.5</td> <td>2366</td> <td> </td></tr> <tr> <td>Ephedrine ((–)-ephedrine)</td> <td>43.1–72.4</td> <td>236–1350</td> <td>&gt;10000</td> <td> </td></tr> <tr> <td>(+)-Ephedrine</td> <td>218</td> <td>2104</td> <td>&gt;10000</td> <td> </td></tr> <tr> <td>Dextromethamphetamine (<i>S</i>(+)-methamphetamine)</td> <td>12.3–13.8</td> <td>8.5–24.5</td> <td>736–1291.7</td> <td> </td></tr> <tr> <td>Levomethamphetamine (<i>R</i>(–)-methamphetamine)</td> <td>28.5</td> <td>416</td> <td>4640</td> <td> </td></tr> <tr> <td>(+)-Phenylpropanolamine ((+)-norephedrine)</td> <td>42.1</td> <td>302</td> <td>&gt;10000</td> <td> </td></tr> <tr> <td>(–)-Phenylpropanolamine ((–)-norephedrine)</td> <td>137</td> <td>1371</td> <td>&gt;10000</td> <td> </td></tr> <tr> <td>Cathine ((+)-norpseudoephedrine)</td> <td>15.0</td> <td>68.3</td> <td>&gt;10000</td> <td> </td></tr> <tr> <td>(–)-Norpseudoephedrine</td> <td>30.1</td> <td>294</td> <td>&gt;10000</td> <td> </td></tr> <tr> <td>(–)-Pseudoephedrine</td> <td>4092</td> <td>9125</td> <td>&gt;10000</td> <td> </td></tr> <tr> <td>Pseudoephedrine ((+)-pseudoephedrine)</td> <td>224</td> <td>1988</td> <td>&gt;10000</td> <td> </td></tr> <tr> <td colspan=\"7\"><b>Notes:</b> The smaller the value, the more strongly the substance releases the neurotransmitter.

The principal mechanism of action relies on its indirect stimulation of the adrenergic receptor system by increasing activation of α- and β-adrenergic receptors via induction of norepinephrine release. The presence of direct interactions with α-adrenergic receptors is unlikely but still controversial. <small>L</small>-ephedrine, and particularly its stereoisomer norpseudoephedrine (which is also present in <i>Catha edulis</i>) has indirect sympathomimetic effects and due to its ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, it is a CNS stimulant similar to amphetamines, but less pronounced, as it releases norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain. </p> <p>The oral bioavailability of ephedrine is 88%. The onset of action of ephedrine orally is 15 to 60&#160;minutes, via intramuscular injection is 10 to 20&#160;minutes, and via intravenous infusion is within seconds. </p> <p>Its plasma protein binding is approximately 24 to 29%, with 5 to 10% bound to albumin. </p> <p>Ephedrine is largely not metabolized. Norephedrine (phenylpropanolamine) is an active metabolite of ephedrine formed via <i>N</i>-demethylation. About 8 to 20% of an oral dose of ephedrine is demethylated into norephedrine, about 4 to 13% is oxidatively deaminated into benzoic acid, and a small fraction is converted into 1,2-dihydroxy-1-phenylpropane. </p> <p>Ephedrine is eliminated mainly in urine, with 60% (range 53–79%) excreted unchanged. </p><p>The elimination half-life of ephedrine is 6&#160;hours. Its duration of action orally is 2 to 4&#160;hours and via intravenous or intramuscular injection is 60&#160;minutes. </p><p>The elimination of ephedrine is dependent on urinary pH. </p> <p>Ephedrine, or (−)-(1<i>R</i>,2<i>S</i>)-ephedrine, also known as (1<i>R</i>,2<i>S</i>)-β-hydroxy-<i>N</i>-methyl-α-methyl-β-phenethylamine or as (1<i>R</i>,2<i>S</i>)-β-hydroxy-<i>N</i>-methylamphetamine, is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine derivative. It is similar in chemical structure to phenylpropanolamine, methamphetamine, and epinephrine (adrenaline). It differs from methamphetamine only by the presence of a hydroxyl group (–OH). Chemically, ephedrine is an alkaloid with a phenethylamine skeleton found in various plants in the genus <i>Ephedra</i> (family Ephedraceae). It is most usually marketed as the hydrochloride or sulfate salt. </p><p>It has an experimental log P of 1.13, while its predicted log P values range from 0.9 to 1.32. The lipophilicity of amphetamines is closely related to their brain permeability. For comparison to ephedrine, the experimental log P of methamphetamine is 2.1, of amphetamine is 1.8, of pseudoephedrine is 0.89, of phenylpropanolamine is 0.7, of phenylephrine is -0.3, and of norepinephrine is -1.2. Methamphetamine has high brain permeability, whereas phenylephrine and norepinephrine are peripherally selective drugs. The optimal log P for brain permeation and central activity is about 2.1 (range 1.5–2.7). </p><p>Ephedrine hydrochloride has a melting point of 187−188&#160;°C. </p><p>The racemic form of ephedrine is racephedrine ((±)-ephedrine; <i>dl</i>-ephedrine; (1<i>RS</i>,2<i>SR</i>)-ephedrine). A stereoisomer of ephedrine is pseudoephedrine. Derivatives of ephedrine include methylephedrine (<i>N</i>-methylephedrine), etafedrine (<i>N</i>-ethylephedrine), cinnamedrine (<i>N</i>-cinnamylephedrine), and oxilofrine (4-hydroxyephedrine). Analogues of ephedrine include phenylpropanolamine (norephedrine) and metaraminol (3-hydroxynorephedrine). </p><p>The presence of an <i>N</i>-methyl group decreases binding affinities at α-adrenergic receptors, compared with norephedrine. Ephedrine, though, binds better than <a href=\"/wiki/N-Methylephedrine\" title=\"N-Methylephedrine\"><i>N</i>-methylephedrine</a>, which has an additional methyl group at the nitrogen atom. Also, the steric orientation of the hydroxyl group is important for receptor binding and functional activity. </p> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Ephedrine_and_pseudoephedrine_isomers.svg\"><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Ephedrine_and_pseudoephedrine_isomers.svg/500px-Ephedrine_and_pseudoephedrine_isomers.svg.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"400\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Ephedrine_and_pseudoephedrine_isomers.svg/600px-Ephedrine_and_pseudoephedrine_isomers.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Ephedrine_and_pseudoephedrine_isomers.svg/800px-Ephedrine_and_pseudoephedrine_isomers.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"512\" data-file-height=\"420\"></a><figcaption>The four stereoisomers of ephedrine.</figcaption></figure> <p>Ephedrine exhibits optical isomerism and has two chiral centres, giving rise to four stereoisomers.

Many commercial immunoassay screening tests directed at the amphetamines cross-react appreciably with ephedrine, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish ephedrine from other phenethylamine derivatives. Blood or plasma ephedrine concentrations are typically in the 20–200&#160;μg/L range in persons taking the drug therapeutically, 300–3000&#160;μg/L in abusers or poisoned patients, and 3–20&#160;mg/L in cases of acute fatal overdosage. The current World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) limit for ephedrine in an athlete's urine is 10&#160;μg/mL. </p> <p>Ephedrine in its natural form, known as <a href=\"/wiki/Ephedra_(plant)\" title=\"Ephedra (plant)\"><i>máhuáng</i></a> (麻黄) in traditional Chinese medicine, has been documented in China since the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) as an antiasthmatic and stimulant. In traditional Chinese medicine, <i>máhuáng</i> has been used as a treatment for asthma and bronchitis for centuries. </p><p>In 1885, the chemical synthesis of ephedrine was first accomplished by Japanese organic chemist Nagai Nagayoshi based on his research on traditional Japanese and Chinese herbal medicines. </p><p>The industrial manufacture of ephedrine in China began in the 1920s, when Merck began marketing and selling the drug as ephetonin. Ephedrine exports from China to the West grew from 4 to 216 tonnes between 1926 and 1928. </p> <p>Ephedrine was first introduced for medical use in the United States in 1926. </p><p>It was introduced in 1948 in Vicks Vatronol nose drops (now discontinued) which contained ephedrine sulfate as the active ingredient for rapid nasal decongestion. </p> <div><h2 >Society and culture</h2><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ephedrine&action=edit&section=21\" title=\"Edit section: Society and culture\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p><i>Ephedrine</i> is the generic name of the drug and its <a href=\"/wiki/British_Approved_Name\" title=\"British Approved Name\"><abbr title=\"British Approved Name\">BAN</abbr></a>Tooltip British Approved Name.

Because of ephedrine's structural similarity to methamphetamine, it can be used to create methamphetamine using chemical reduction in which ephedrine's hydroxyl group is removed; this has made ephedrine a highly sought-after chemical precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine. </p><p>The most popular method for reducing ephedrine to methamphetamine is similar to the Birch reduction, in that it uses anhydrous ammonia and lithium metal in the reaction. The second-most popular method uses red phosphorus and iodine in the reaction with ephedrine. Moreover, ephedrine can be synthesized into methcathinone via simple oxidation. As such, ephedrine is listed as a table-I precursor under the <i>United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances</i>. </p> <div><h3 >Use in exercise and sports</h3><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Ephedrine&action=edit&section=24\" title=\"Edit section: Use in exercise and sports\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Ephedrine has been used as a performance-enhancing drug in exercise and sports.

Ephedrine is still sold as an oral nasal decongestant in 8&#160;mg pills as a natural health product (NHP), with a limit of 0.4&#160;g (400&#160;mg) per package, the limit established by the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act as it is considered as Class A Precursor. </p><p>NHPs containing ephedrine or pseudoephdrine as their sole active ingredients are restricted to being behind-the-counter at pharmacies, requiring customers to request them from the pharmacist. Combination NHPs containing other ingredients can be in a regular pharmacy self-selection area for purchase, but are still restricted to pharmacies and a pharmacist must be available to answer questions from a customer if necessary. </p> <p>In 1997, the FDA proposed a regulation on ephedra (the herb from which ephedrine is obtained), which limited an ephedra dose to 8&#160;mg (of active ephedrine) with no more than 24&#160;mg per day. This proposed rule was withdrawn, in part, in 2000 because of \"concerns regarding the agency's basis for proposing a certain dietary ingredient level and a duration of use limit for these products.\" In 2004, the FDA created a ban on ephedrine alkaloids marketed for reasons other than asthma, colds, allergies, other disease, or traditional Asian use. On April 14, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah ruled the FDA did not have proper evidence that low dosages of ephedrine alkaloids are actually unsafe, but on August 17, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver upheld the FDA's final rule declaring all dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids adulterated, and therefore illegal for marketing in the United States. Furthermore, ephedrine is banned by the NCAA, MLB, NFL, and PGA. Ephedrine is, however, still legal in many applications outside of dietary supplements. Purchasing is currently limited and monitored, with specifics varying from state to state. </p><p>The House passed the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 as an amendment to the renewal of the USA PATRIOT Act. Signed into law by President George W. Bush on March 6, 2006, the act amended the US Code (21 USC 830) concerning the sale of products containing ephedrine and the closely related drug pseudoephedrine. Both substances are used as precursors in the illicit production of methamphetamine, and to discourage that use the federal statute included the following requirements for merchants who sell these products: </p> <ul><li>A retrievable record of all purchases identifying the name and address of each party to be kept for two years</li> <li>Required verification of proof of identity of all purchasers</li> <li>Required protection and disclosure methods in the collection of personal information</li> <li>Reports to the Attorney General of any suspicious payments or disappearances of the regulated products</li> <li>Non-liquid dose form of regulated product may only be sold in unit-dose blister packs</li> <li>Regulated products are to be sold behind the counter or in a locked cabinet in such a way as to restrict access</li> <li>Daily sales of regulated products not to exceed 3.6&#160;g to a single purchaser, without regard to the number of transactions</li> <li>Monthly sales to a single purchaser not to exceed 9&#160;g of pseudoephedrine base in regulated products</li></ul> <p>The law gives similar regulations to mail-order purchases, except the monthly sales limit is 7.5&#160;g. </p><p>As a pure herb or tea, <i>má huáng</i>, containing ephedrine, is still sold legally in the US. The law restricts/prohibits its being sold as a dietary supplement (pill) or as an ingredient/additive to other products, like diet pills. </p> <p>Ephedrine and all <i>Ephedra</i> species that contain it are considered Schedule 4 substances under the Poisons Standard. A Schedule 4 drug is considered a Prescription Only Medicine, or Prescription Animal Remedy – Substances, the use or supply of which should be by or on the order of persons permitted by State or Territory legislation to prescribe and should be available from a pharmacist on prescription under the Poisons Standard. </p> <p>In South Africa, ephedrine was moved to schedule 6 on 27 May 2008, which makes pure ephedrine tablets prescription only. Pills containing ephedrine up to 30&#160;mg per tablet in combination with other medications are still available OTC, schedule 1 and 2, for sinus, head colds, and influenza. </p> <p>Ephedrine was freely available in pharmacies in Germany until 2001. Afterward, access was restricted since it was mostly bought for unindicated uses. Similarly, ephedra can only be bought with a prescription. Since April 2006, all products, including plant parts, that contain ephedrine are only available with a prescription. </p> <p>Ephedrine is obtained from the plant <i>Ephedra sinica</i> and other members of the genus <i>Ephedra,</i> from which the name of the substance is derived. Raw materials for the manufacture of ephedrine and traditional Chinese medicines are produced in China on a large scale. As of 2007, companies produced for export US$13 million worth of ephedrine from 30,000 tons of ephedra annually, or about ten times the amount used in traditional Chinese medicine. </p> <p>Most of the l-ephedrine produced today for official medical use is made synthetically as the extraction and isolation process from <i>E. sinica</i> is tedious and no longer cost-effective. </p> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Ephedrine_biosynthesis.svg\"><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Ephedrine_biosynthesis.svg/500px-Ephedrine_biosynthesis.svg.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"400\" height=\"202\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Ephedrine_biosynthesis.svg/600px-Ephedrine_biosynthesis.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Ephedrine_biosynthesis.svg/800px-Ephedrine_biosynthesis.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"512\" data-file-height=\"258\"></a><figcaption>Proposed biosynthetic pathway of ephedrine from <small>L</small>-phenylalanine and pyruvic acid.</figcaption></figure> <p>Ephedrine was long thought to come from modifying the amino acid <small>L</small>-phenylalanine. <small>L</small>-Phenylalanine would be decarboxylated and subsequently attacked with ω-aminoacetophenone. Methylation of this product would then produce ephedrine. This pathway has since been disproven. A new pathway proposed suggests that phenylalanine first forms cinnamoyl-CoA via the enzymes phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and acyl CoA ligase. The cinnamoyl-CoA is then reacted with a hydratase to attach the alcohol functional group. The product is then reacted with a retro-aldolase, forming benzaldehyde. Benzaldehyde reacts with pyruvic acid to attach a 2-carbon unit. This product then undergoes transamination and methylation to form ephedrine and its stereoisomer, pseudoephedrine. </p> <div><ol> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b> <cite >Anvisa (2023-03-31). <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.in.gov.br/en/web/dou/-/resolucao-rdc-n-784-de-31-de-marco-de-2023-474904992\">\"RDC Nº 784 - Listas de Substâncias Entorpecentes, Psicotrópicas, Precursoras e Outras sob Controle Especial\"</a> [Collegiate Board Resolution No. 784 - Lists of Narcotic, Psychotropic, Precursor, and Other Substances under Special Control] (in Brazilian Portuguese).

Hansch and Leo54 reasoned that highly lipophilic molecules will be partitioned into the lipid interior of membranes and will be retained there. However, ClogP correlates nicely with LogBBB with increasing lipophilicity and increasing brain penetration. For several classes of CNS active substances, Hansch and Leo54 found that blood-brain barrier penetration is optimal when the LogP values are in the range of 1.5-2.7, with a mean value of 2.1. An analysis of small drug-like molecules suggested that for better brain permeation46 and for good intestinal permeability55 the LogD values need to be greater than 0 and less than 3. In comparison, the mean value for ClogP for the marketed CNS drugs is 2.5, which is in good agreement with the range found by Hansch et al.22</q></cite></span> </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-Budavari_57-0\">^</a></b> <cite >Budavari S (ed.). <i>The Merck Index: An encyclopedia of chemicals, drugs, and biologicals</i> (12th&#160;ed.).

is a [central nervous system](/wiki/Central_nervous_system) (CNS) [stimulant](/wiki/Stimulant) and [sympathomimetic agent](/wiki/Sympathomimetic_agent) that is often used to prevent [low blood pressure](/wiki/Hypotension) during [anesthesia](/wiki/Anesthesia).[[11]](#cite_note-AHFS2016-11) It has also been used for [asthma](/wiki/Asthma), [narcolepsy](/wiki/Narcolepsy), and [obesity](/wiki/Obesity) but is not the preferred treatment.[[11]](#cite_note-AHFS2016-11) It is of unclear benefit in [nasal congestion](/wiki/Nasal_congestion).[[11]](#cite_note-AHFS2016-11) It can be taken [by mouth](/wiki/Oral_administration) or by [injection into a muscle](/wiki/Intramuscular), [vein](/wiki/Intravenous), or [just under the skin](/wiki/Subcutaneous_injection).[[11]](#cite_note-AHFS2016-11) Onset with intravenous use is fast, while injection into a muscle can take 20&#160;minutes, and by mouth can take an hour for effect.[[11]](#cite_note-AHFS2016-11) When given by injection, it lasts about an hour, and when taken by mouth, it can last up to four hours.[[11]](#cite_note-AHFS2016-11)\nCommon [side effects](/wiki/Side_effect) include [trouble sleeping](/wiki/Insomnia), [anxiety](/wiki/Anxiety), [headache](/wiki/Headache), [hallucinations](/wiki/Hallucination), [high blood pressure](/wiki/Hypertension), [fast heart rate](/wiki/Tachycardia), [loss of appetite](/wiki/Decreased_appetite), and [urinary retention](/wiki/Urinary_retention).[[11]](#cite_note-AHFS2016-11) Serious side effects include [stroke](/wiki/Stroke) and [heart attack](/wiki/Myocardial_infarction).[[11]](#cite_note-AHFS2016-11) While probably safe in [pregnancy](/wiki/Pregnancy), its use in this population is poorly studied.[[12]](#cite_note-12)[[13]](#cite_note-PB2016-13) Use during [breastfeeding](/wiki/Breastfeeding) is not recommended.[[13]](#cite_note-PB2016-13) Ephedrine works by [inducing the release of norepinephrine](/wiki/Norepinephrine_releasing_agent) and hence indirectly activating the [α-](/wiki/%CE%91-adrenergic_receptor) and [β-adrenergic receptors](/wiki/%CE%92-adrenergic_receptor).[[11]](#cite_note-AHFS2016-11) Chemically, ephedrine is a [substituted amphetamine](/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) and is the (1*R*,2*S*)-[enantiomer](/wiki/Enantiomer) of [β-hydroxy-*N*-methylamphetamine](/wiki/Hydroxymethylamphetamine).[[14]](#cite_note-PubChem-14)\nEphedrine was first [isolated](/wiki/Chemical_isolate) in 1885 and came into commercial use in 1926.[[15]](#cite_note-15)[[16]](#cite_note-Fis2006-16) It is on the [World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines](/wiki/WHO_Model_List_of_Essential_Medicines).[[17]](#cite_note-WHO22nd-17) It is available as a [generic medication](/wiki/Generic_medication).[[11]](#cite_note-AHFS2016-11) It can normally be found in plants of the *[Ephedra](/wiki/Ephedra_(plant))* genus.[[11]](#cite_note-AHFS2016-11)[[18]](#cite_note-AbourashedEl-AlfyKhan2003-18) [Over-the-counter](/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug) [dietary supplements](/wiki/Dietary_supplement) containing ephedrine are illegal in the United States,[[11]](#cite_note-AHFS2016-11) with the exception of those used in [traditional Chinese medicine](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine), where its presence is noted by [*má huáng*](/wiki/Ephedra_(plant)).[[11]](#cite_note-AHFS2016-11)[[18]](#cite_note-AbourashedEl-AlfyKhan2003-18)\n\n[*](/wiki/File:EphedrineInBottles.jpg)Ephedrine Sulphate (1932), Ephedrine Compound (1932), and Swan-Myers Ephedrine Inhalant No. 66 (circa* 1940).\nEphedrine is a non-[catecholamine](/wiki/Catecholamine) [sympathomimetic](/wiki/Sympathomimetic) with cardiovascular effects similar to those of [adrenaline](/wiki/Adrenaline) (epinephrine): increased blood pressure, heart rate, and contractility. Like [pseudoephedrine](/wiki/Pseudoephedrine), it is a [bronchodilator](/wiki/Bronchodilator), with pseudoephedrine having considerably less effect.[[19]](#cite_note-Butterworth2022-19)[[20]](#cite_note-drew-20)\nEphedrine may decrease [motion sickness](/wiki/Motion_sickness), but it has mainly been used to decrease the sedating effects of other medications used for motion sickness.[[21]](#cite_note-21)[[22]](#cite_note-22)\nEphedrine is also found to have quick and long-lasting responsiveness in [congenital myasthenic syndrome](/wiki/Congenital_myasthenic_syndrome) in early childhood and also even in adults with a novel [COLQ](/wiki/COLQ) mutation.[[23]](#cite_note-23)\nEphedrine is administered by intravenous boluses. Redosing usually requires increased doses to offset the development of [tachyphylaxis](/wiki/Tachyphylaxis), which is attributed to the depletion of catecholamine stores.[[19]](#cite_note-Butterworth2022-19)\n\nEphedrine promotes modest short-term [weight loss](/wiki/Weight_loss),[[24]](#cite_note-24) specifically fat loss, but its long-term effects are unknown.[[25]](#cite_note-25) In mice, ephedrine is known to stimulate [thermogenesis](/wiki/Thermogenesis) in the [brown adipose tissue](/wiki/Brown_adipose_tissue), but because adult humans have only small amounts of brown fat, thermogenesis is assumed to take place mostly in the [skeletal muscle](/wiki/Skeletal_muscle). Ephedrine also decreases [gastric emptying](/wiki/Gastric_emptying).

As such, ephedrine is listed as a table-I precursor under the *[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances](/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_Against_Illicit_Traffic_in_Narcotic_Drugs_and_Psychotropic_Substances)*.[[70]](#cite_note-UN-70)\n\n### Use in exercise and sports\n\nEphedrine has been used as a [performance-enhancing drug](/wiki/Performance-enhancing_drug) in [exercise](/wiki/Exercise) and [sports](/wiki/Sports).[[41]](#cite_note-Docherty2008-41)[[71]](#cite_note-Lieberman2001-71)[[72]](#cite_note-MagkosKayouras2004-72)[[73]](#cite_note-Graham2001-73) It can increase [heart rate](/wiki/Heart_rate), [blood pressure](/wiki/Blood_pressure), and [cardiac contractility](/wiki/Cardiac_contractility) as well as act as a [psychostimulant](/wiki/Psychostimulant).[[41]](#cite_note-Docherty2008-41) Ephedrine is often used in combination with [caffeine](/wiki/Caffeine) for performance-enhancing purposes.[[72]](#cite_note-MagkosKayouras2004-72)[[73]](#cite_note-Graham2001-73)\n\nIn [chemical synthesis](/wiki/Chemical_synthesis), ephedrine is used in bulk quantities as a [chiral auxiliary](/wiki/Chiral_auxiliary) group.[[74]](#cite_note-74)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/EphedrineChiralAuxiliary.svg/600px-EphedrineChiralAuxiliary.svg.png)](/wiki/File:EphedrineChiralAuxiliary.svg)\nIn [saquinavir](/wiki/Saquinavir) synthesis, the half-acid is resolved as its salt with l-ephedrine.\n\nIn January 2002, [Health Canada](/wiki/Health_Canada) issued a voluntary recall of all ephedrine products containing more than 8&#160;mg per dose, all combinations of ephedrine with other stimulants such as caffeine, and all ephedrine products marketed for weight-loss or bodybuilding indications, citing a serious risk to health.[[75]](#cite_note-health-canada-75) Ephedrine is still sold as an oral nasal decongestant[[76]](#cite_note-LaccourreyeWerner2015-76) in 8&#160;mg pills as a natural health product (NHP), with a limit of 0.4&#160;g (400&#160;mg) per package, the limit established by the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act as it is considered as Class A Precursor.[[77]](#cite_note-77)\nNHPs containing ephedrine or pseudoephdrine as their sole active ingredients are restricted to being behind-the-counter at pharmacies, requiring customers to request them from the pharmacist. Combination NHPs containing other ingredients can be in a regular pharmacy self-selection area for purchase, but are still restricted to pharmacies and a pharmacist must be available to answer questions from a customer if necessary.[[78]](#cite_note-78)[[79]](#cite_note-79)[[80]](#cite_note-80)\n\nIn 1997, the [FDA](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) proposed a regulation on ephedra (the herb from which ephedrine is obtained), which limited an ephedra dose to 8&#160;mg (of active ephedrine) with no more than 24&#160;mg per day.[[81]](#cite_note-81) This proposed rule was withdrawn, in part, in 2000 because of \"concerns regarding the agency's basis for proposing a certain dietary ingredient level and a duration of use limit for these products.\"[[82]](#cite_note-82) In 2004, the FDA created a ban on ephedrine alkaloids marketed for reasons other than asthma, colds, allergies, other disease, or traditional Asian use.[[83]](#cite_note-83) On April 14, 2005, the [U.S. District Court for the District of Utah](/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Utah) ruled the FDA did not have proper evidence that low dosages of ephedrine alkaloids are actually unsafe,[[84]](#cite_note-84) but on August 17, 2006, the [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit](/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Tenth_Circuit) in Denver upheld the FDA's final rule declaring all dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids adulterated, and therefore illegal for marketing in the United States.[[85]](#cite_note-85) Furthermore, ephedrine is banned by the NCAA, MLB, NFL, and PGA.[[86]](#cite_note-86) Ephedrine is, however, still legal in many applications outside of dietary supplements. Purchasing is currently limited and monitored, with specifics varying from state to state.\nThe [House](/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives) passed the [Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005](/wiki/Combat_Methamphetamine_Epidemic_Act_of_2005) as an amendment to the renewal of the [USA PATRIOT Act](/wiki/USA_PATRIOT_Act). Signed into law by President [George W. Bush](/wiki/George_W._Bush) on March 6, 2006, the act amended the [US Code](/wiki/US_Code) (21 USC 830) concerning the sale of products containing ephedrine and the closely related drug [pseudoephedrine](/wiki/Pseudoephedrine). Both substances are used as [precursors](/wiki/Drug_precursors) in the [illicit production](/wiki/Clandestine_chemistry) of [methamphetamine](/wiki/Methamphetamine), and to discourage that use the federal statute included the following requirements for merchants who sell these products:\n\n- A retrievable record of all purchases identifying the name and address of each party to be kept for two years\n\n- Required verification of proof of identity of all purchasers\n\n- Required protection and disclosure methods in the collection of personal information\n\n- Reports to the [Attorney General](/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General) of any suspicious payments or disappearances of the regulated products\n\n- Non-liquid dose form of regulated product may only be sold in unit-dose blister packs\n\n- Regulated products are to be sold behind the counter or in a locked cabinet in such a way as to restrict access\n\n- Daily sales of regulated products not to exceed 3.6&#160;g to a single purchaser, without regard to the number of transactions\n\n- Monthly sales to a single purchaser not to exceed 9&#160;g of pseudoephedrine base in regulated products\n\nThe law gives similar regulations to mail-order purchases, except the monthly sales limit is 7.5&#160;g.\nAs a pure herb or tea, *má huáng*, containing ephedrine, is still sold legally in the US. The law restricts/prohibits its being sold as a dietary supplement (pill) or as an ingredient/additive to other products, like diet pills.\n\nEphedrine and all *Ephedra* species that contain it are considered Schedule 4 substances under the [Poisons Standard](/wiki/Standard_for_the_Uniform_Scheduling_of_Medicines_and_Poisons). A Schedule 4 drug is considered a Prescription Only Medicine, or Prescription Animal Remedy – Substances, the use or supply of which should be by or on the order of persons permitted by State or Territory legislation to prescribe and should be available from a pharmacist on prescription under the [Poisons Standard](/wiki/Standard_for_the_Uniform_Scheduling_of_Medicines_and_Poisons).\n\nIn South Africa, ephedrine was moved to schedule 6 on 27 May 2008,[[87]](#cite_note-87) which makes pure ephedrine tablets prescription only. Pills containing ephedrine up to 30&#160;mg per tablet in combination with other medications are still available OTC, schedule 1 and 2, for sinus, head colds, and influenza.\n\nEphedrine was freely available in pharmacies in Germany until 2001. Afterward, access was restricted since it was mostly bought for unindicated uses. Similarly, ephedra can only be bought with a prescription. Since April 2006, all products, including plant parts, that contain ephedrine are only available with a prescription.[[88]](#cite_note-88)\n\nEphedrine is obtained from the plant *[Ephedra sinica](/wiki/Ephedra_sinica)* and other members of the genus *[Ephedra](/wiki/Ephedra_(plant)),* from which the name of the substance is derived. Raw materials for the manufacture of ephedrine and traditional Chinese medicines are produced in China on a large scale. As of 2007, companies produced for export US$13 million worth of ephedrine from 30,000 tons of ephedra annually, or about ten times the amount used in traditional Chinese medicine.[[89]](#cite_note-Chen-89)\n\nMost of the l-ephedrine produced today for official medical use is made synthetically as the extraction and isolation process from *E. sinica* is tedious and no longer cost-effective.[[90]](#cite_note-90)[*[unreliable source?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources)*]\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Ephedrine_biosynthesis.svg/500px-Ephedrine_biosynthesis.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Ephedrine_biosynthesis.svg)Proposed biosynthetic pathway of ephedrine from L-phenylalanine and pyruvic acid.[[91]](#cite_note-Hertweck-91)[[92]](#cite_note-Grue-Sorensen_3714–3715-92)\nEphedrine was long thought to come from modifying the amino acid L-phenylalanine.[[93]](#cite_note-sciencedirect.com-93) L-Phenylalanine would be decarboxylated and subsequently attacked with ω-aminoacetophenone. Methylation of this product would then produce ephedrine. This pathway has since been disproven.[[93]](#cite_note-sciencedirect.com-93) A new pathway proposed suggests that phenylalanine first forms [cinnamoyl-CoA](/wiki/Cinnamoyl-CoA) via the enzymes [phenylalanine ammonia-lyase](/wiki/Phenylalanine_ammonia-lyase) and acyl CoA ligase.[[91]](#cite_note-Hertweck-91) The cinnamoyl-CoA is then reacted with a hydratase to attach the alcohol functional group. The product is then reacted with a retro-aldolase, forming [benzaldehyde](/wiki/Benzaldehyde). Benzaldehyde reacts with [pyruvic acid](/wiki/Pyruvic_acid) to attach a 2-carbon unit. This product then undergoes transamination and methylation to form ephedrine and its stereoisomer, pseudoephedrine.[[92]](#cite_note-Grue-Sorensen_3714–3715-92)\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-1)** [Anvisa](/wiki/Brazilian_Health_Regulatory_Agency) (2023-03-31).

Hansch and Leo54 reasoned that highly lipophilic molecules will be partitioned into the lipid interior of membranes and will be retained there. However, ClogP correlates nicely with LogBBB with increasing lipophilicity and increasing brain penetration. For several classes of CNS active substances, Hansch and Leo54 found that blood-brain barrier penetration is optimal when the LogP values are in the range of 1.5-2.7, with a mean value of 2.1. An analysis of small drug-like molecules suggested that for better brain permeation46 and for good intestinal permeability55 the LogD values need to be greater than 0 and less than 3. In comparison, the mean value for ClogP for the marketed CNS drugs is 2.5, which is in good agreement with the range found by Hansch et al.22\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-Budavari_57-0)** Budavari S (ed.). *The Merck Index: An encyclopedia of chemicals, drugs, and biologicals* (12th&#160;ed.).

          "abstract": "Ephedra Herb is defined in the 17th edition of the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP) as the terrestrial stem of Ephedra sinica Stapf., Ephedra intermedia Schrenk et C.A. Meyer, or Ephedra equisetina Bunge (Ephedraceae). The stems of Ephedra Herb contain greater than 0.7% ephedrine alkaloids (ephedrine and pseudoephedrine). Despite its high effectiveness, Ephedra Herb exert several adverse effects, including palpitation, excitation, insomnia, and dysuria. Both the primary and adverse effects of Ephedra Herb have been traditionally believed to be mediated by these ephedrine alkaloids. However, our study found that several pharmacological actions of Ephedra Herb were not associated with ephedrine alkaloids. We prepared an ephedrine alkaloid-free Ephedra Herb extract (EFE) by eliminating ephedrine alkaloids from Ephedra Herb extract (EHE) using ion-exchange column chromatography. EFE exerted analgesic, anti-influenza, and anticancer activities in the same manner as EHE. Moreover, EFE did not induce adverse effects due to ephedrine alkaloids, such as excitation, insomnia, and arrhythmias, and showed no toxicity. Furthermore, we evaluated the safety of EFE in healthy volunteers. The number of adverse event cases was higher in the EHE-treated group than in the EFE-treated group, although the difference was not significant. Our evidence suggested that EFE was safer than EHE.",

          "abstract": "Ephedrine abuse has spread in many parts of the world, severely threatening human health. The mechanism of ephedrine toxicity is still unclear. To explore the possible neural mechanisms of ephedrine toxicity, this study established a non-human primate model of ephedrine exposure, analyzed the functional connectivity changes in its prefrontal cortex through resting state BOLD-fMRI, and then inspected the pathophysiological changes as well as the expression of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB), phosphorylated CREB (P-CREB), and CREB target proteins (c-fos and fosB) in the prefrontal cortex. After ephedrine toxicity, we found that the prefrontal cortex of monkeys strengthened its functional connectivity with the brain regions that perform motivation, drive, reward, and learning and memory functions and weakened its functional connectivity with the brain regions that perform cognitive control. These results suggest that ephedrine toxicity causes abnormal neural circuits that lead to the amplification and enhancement of drug-related cues and the weakening and damage of cognitive control function. Histology showed that the neurocytotoxicity of ephedrine can cause neuronal degeneration and apoptosis. Real-time PCR and Western blot showed increased expression of CREB mRNA and CREB/P-CREB/c-fos/fosB protein in the prefrontal cortex after ephedrine toxicity. Collectively, the present study indicates that the enhancement of drug-related cues and the weakening of cognitive control caused by abnormal neural circuits after drug exposure may be a major mechanism of brain function changes caused by ephedrine. These histological and molecular changes may be the pathophysiological basis of brain function changes caused by ephedrine.",

<p><b>Clenbuterol</b> is a sympathomimetic amine used by sufferers of breathing disorders as a decongestant and bronchodilator. People with chronic breathing disorders such as asthma use this as a bronchodilator to make breathing easier. It is most commonly available as the hydrochloride salt, clenbuterol hydrochloride. </p><p>It was patented in 1967 and came into medical use in 1977. </p> <meta property=\"mw:PageProp/toc\"> <p>Clenbuterol is approved for use in some countries as a bronchodilator for asthma. </p><p>Clenbuterol is a <a href=\"/wiki/Beta2-adrenergic_agonist\" title=\"Beta2-adrenergic agonist\">β<sub>2</sub> agonist</a> with some structural and pharmacological similarities to epinephrine and salbutamol (albuterol), but its effects are more potent and longer-lasting as a stimulant and thermogenic drug. It is commonly used for smooth muscle-relaxant properties as a bronchodilator and tocolytic. </p><p>It is classified by the World Anti-Doping Agency as an anabolic agent, not as a β<sub>2</sub> agonist. </p> <p>Clenbuterol can cause these side effects: </p> <ul><li>Nervousness</li> <li>Thyrotoxicosis</li> <li>Tachycardia</li> <li>Subaortic stenosis</li> <li>High blood pressure</li></ul> <p>Use over the recommended dose of about 120 μg can cause muscle tremors, headache, dizziness, and gastric irritation. Persons self-administering the drug for weight loss or to improve athletic performance have experienced nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, palpitations, tachycardia, and myocardial infarction. Use of the drug may be confirmed by detecting its presence in semen or urine. </p> <p>Clenbuterol acts as a <a href=\"/wiki/%CE%922-adrenergic_receptor\" title=\"Β2-adrenergic receptor\">β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor</a> agonist. </p> <div><h2 >Society and culture</h2><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clenbuterol&action=edit&section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Society and culture\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Clenbuterol is not an ingredient of any therapeutic drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is now banned for IOC-tested athletes. In the US, administration of clenbuterol to any animal that could be used as food for human consumption is banned by the FDA. </p> <p>Although often used by bodybuilders during their \"cutting\" cycles, the drug has been more recently known to the mainstream, particularly through publicized stories of use by celebrities such as Victoria Beckham, Britney Spears, and Lindsay Lohan, for its off-label use as a weight-loss drug similar to usage of other sympathomimetic amines such as ephedrine, despite the lack of sufficient clinical testing either supporting or negating such use. In 2021, Odalis Santos Mena, a Mexican fitness influencer, died after suffering a cardiac arrest while being anesthetized for a procedure of miraDry, a treatment that uses thermal energy to eliminate underarm sweat glands. The coroner reported that Mena's death was attributed to a combination of clenbuterol and anesthesia. </p> <div><h3 >Performance-enhancing drug</h3><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Clenbuterol&action=edit&section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Performance-enhancing drug\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>A common misconception about clenbuterol is that it has anabolic properties, and can increase muscle mass when used in higher dosages. This claim has never been substantiated, and likely originated from equine research. A β<sub>2</sub> agonist, Clenbuterol has been found to increase short-term work rate and cardiovascular output, and consequently, its anabolic effects in horses can be attributed to exercise output and increased caloric intake. Given its ability to increase basal metabolic rate, maximum heart rate, and exercise output, Clenbuterol has ergogenic properties more closely related to ephedrine or amphetamine. </p><p>The notion that Clenbuterol is an anabolic agent likely originated from author and renowned authority on performance-enhancement Dan Duchaine. Duchaine popularized the drug in the bodybuilding community, and was the first to suggest the drug had muscle-building properties. Likewise, Duchaine erred in promoting the drug Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) as an anabolic agent, and served time for the unlawful possession and distribution of the drug in the mid-1990s. As of 2011, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) listed clenbuterol as an anabolic agent, despite the fact there is no evidence to suggest this is the case. </p><p>Clenbuterol has also been used as a performance-enhancing drug. One issue is that clenbuterol is a food contaminant in some countries; doping control must distinguish between accidental and deliberate intake. </p> <p>Clenbuterol is occasionally referred to as \"bute\" and this risks confusion with phenylbutazone, also called \"bute\". Phenylbutazone, which is a drug also used with horses, was tested for in the 2013 European meat adulteration scandal. </p><p>Intended to result in leaner meat with a higher muscle-to-fat ratio, the use of clenbuterol has been banned in meat since 1991 in the US and since 1996 in the European Union. The drug is banned due to health concerns about symptoms noted in consumers. These include increased heart rate, muscular tremors, headaches, nausea, fever, and chills. In several cases in Europe, these adverse symptoms have been temporary. </p><p>Clenbuterol is a growth-promoting drug in the β agonist class of compounds. It is not licensed for use in China, the United States, or the EU for food-producing animals, but some countries have approved it for animals not used for food, and a few countries have approved it for therapeutic uses in food-producing animals. </p><p>Not just athletes are affected by contamination. In Portugal, 50 people were reported as affected by clenbuterol in liver and pork between 1998 and 2002, while in 1990, veal liver was suspected of causing clenbuterol poisoning in 22 people in France and 135 people in Spain. </p><p>In September 2006, some 330 people in Shanghai suffered from food poisoning after eating clenbuterol-contaminated pork. </p><p>In February 2009, at least 70 people in one Chinese province (Guangdong) suffered food poisoning after eating pig organs believed to contain clenbuterol residue. The victims complained of stomach aches and diarrhea after eating pig organs bought in local markets. </p><p>In March 2011, China's Ministry of Agriculture said the government would launch a one-year crackdown on illegal additives in pig feed, after a subsidiary of Shuanghui Group, China's largest meat producer, was exposed for using clenbuterol-contaminated pork in its meat products. A total of 72 people in central Henan Province, where Shuanghui is based, were taken into police custody for allegedly producing, selling, or using clenbuterol. The situation has dramatically improved in China since September 2011, when a ban of clenbuterol was announced by China's Ministry of Agriculture. </p><p>Authorities around the world appear to be issuing stricter food safety requirements, such as the Food Safety Modernization Act in the United States, Canada's revision of their import regulations, China's new food laws published since 2009, South Africa's new food law, and many more global changes and restrictions. </p> <p>Clenbuterol is administered as an aerosol for the treatment of allergic respiratory disease in horses as a bronchodilator, and intravenously in cattle to relax the uterus in cows at the time of parturition, specifically to facilitate exteriorisation of the uterus during Caesarian section surgery. It is licensed for obstetrical use in cattle as Planipart Solution for Injection. </p><p>It is illegal in some countries to use in livestock used for food. </p> <ul><li>Mabuterol (same structure as clenbuterol but one of the chloro groups has been changed to a trifluoromethyl group instead)</li> <li>Cimaterol</li></ul> <div><ol> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b> <cite >Center for Veterinary Medicine. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090710082434/http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/Products/ApprovedAnimalDrugProducts/FOIADrugSummaries/ucm054881.htm\">\"FOIA Drug Summaries - NADA 140-973 VENTIPULMIN® SYRUP - original approval\"</a>. <i>www.fda.gov</i>.

is a [sympathomimetic](/wiki/Sympathomimetic) [amine](/wiki/Amine) used by sufferers of breathing disorders as a [decongestant](/wiki/Decongestant) and [bronchodilator](/wiki/Bronchodilator). People with chronic breathing disorders such as [asthma](/wiki/Asthma) use this as a [bronchodilator](/wiki/Bronchodilator) to make breathing easier. It is most commonly available as the [hydrochloride](/wiki/Hydrochloride) [salt](/wiki/Salt_(chemistry)), clenbuterol hydrochloride.[[2]](#cite_note-2)\nIt was patented in 1967 and came into medical use in 1977.[[3]](#cite_note-Fis2006-3)\n\nClenbuterol is approved for use in some countries as a bronchodilator for asthma.[*[medical citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine))*]\nClenbuterol is a [β2 agonist](/wiki/Beta2-adrenergic_agonist) with some structural and pharmacological similarities to [epinephrine](/wiki/Epinephrine) and [salbutamol](/wiki/Salbutamol) (albuterol), but its effects are more potent and longer-lasting as a stimulant and [thermogenic](/wiki/Thermogenic) drug.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] It is commonly used for [smooth muscle](/wiki/Smooth_muscle)-relaxant properties as a bronchodilator and [tocolytic](/wiki/Tocolytic).\nIt is classified by the [World Anti-Doping Agency](/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency) as an [anabolic agent](/wiki/Anabolic_agent), not as a β2 agonist.[[4]](#cite_note-4)\n\nClenbuterol can cause these side effects:[[5]](#cite_note-5)\n\n- Nervousness\n\n- [Thyrotoxicosis](/wiki/Thyrotoxicosis)\n\n- [Tachycardia](/wiki/Tachycardia)\n\n- Subaortic [stenosis](/wiki/Stenosis)\n\n- [High blood pressure](/wiki/High_blood_pressure)\n\nUse over the recommended dose of about 120 μg can cause muscle tremors, headache, dizziness, and gastric irritation. Persons self-administering the drug for weight loss or to improve athletic performance have experienced nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, palpitations, tachycardia, and myocardial infarction. Use of the drug may be confirmed by detecting its presence in semen or urine.[[6]](#cite_note-6)\n\nClenbuterol acts as a [β2-adrenergic receptor](/wiki/%CE%922-adrenergic_receptor) [agonist](/wiki/Agonist).[*[medical citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine))*]\n\n## Society and culture\n\nClenbuterol is not an ingredient of any therapeutic drug approved by the US [Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) (FDA)[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] and is now banned for [IOC](/wiki/IOC)-tested athletes.[[7]](#cite_note-independent-7) In the US, administration of clenbuterol to any animal that could be used as food for human consumption is banned by the FDA.[[8]](#cite_note-8)[[9]](#cite_note-9)\n\nAlthough often used by [bodybuilders](/wiki/Bodybuilder) during their \"cutting\" cycles,[[10]](#cite_note-10) the drug has been more recently[*[as of?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items)*] known to the mainstream, particularly through publicized stories of use by celebrities such as [Victoria Beckham](/wiki/Victoria_Beckham),[[7]](#cite_note-independent-7) [Britney Spears](/wiki/Britney_Spears), and [Lindsay Lohan](/wiki/Lindsay_Lohan),[[11]](#cite_note-11) for its [off-label use](/wiki/Off-label_use) as a weight-loss drug similar to usage of other sympathomimetic amines such as [ephedrine](/wiki/Ephedrine), despite the lack of sufficient clinical testing either supporting or negating such use.\nIn 2021, Odalis Santos Mena, a Mexican fitness influencer, died after suffering a cardiac arrest while being anesthetized for a procedure of [miraDry](/wiki/MiraDry), a treatment that uses thermal energy to eliminate underarm sweat glands. The coroner reported that Mena's death was attributed to a combination of clenbuterol and anesthesia.\n\n### Performance-enhancing drug\n\nA common misconception about clenbuterol is that it has [anabolic](/wiki/Anabolic) properties, and can increase muscle mass when used in higher dosages. This claim has never been substantiated, and likely originated from equine research.[[12]](#cite_note-12) A β2 agonist, Clenbuterol has been found to increase short-term work rate and [cardiovascular output](/wiki/Cardiovascular_fitness), and consequently, its anabolic effects in horses can be attributed to exercise output and increased caloric intake. Given its ability to increase [basal metabolic rate](/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate), [maximum heart rate](/wiki/Maximum_heart_rate), and exercise output, Clenbuterol has [ergogenic](/wiki/Ergogenic) properties more closely related to [ephedrine](/wiki/Ephedrine) or [amphetamine](/wiki/Amphetamine). \nThe notion that Clenbuterol is an anabolic agent likely originated from author and renowned authority on performance-enhancement [Dan Duchaine](/wiki/Dan_Duchaine). Duchaine popularized the drug in the bodybuilding community, and was the first to suggest the drug had muscle-building properties. Likewise, Duchaine erred in promoting the drug [Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid](/wiki/Gamma-hydroxybutyric_acid) (GHB) as an anabolic agent, and served time for the unlawful possession and distribution of the drug in the mid-1990s.[[13]](#cite_note-13)\nAs of 2011, the [World Anti-Doping Agency](/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency) (WADA) listed clenbuterol as an anabolic agent, despite the fact there is no evidence to suggest this is the case.[[14]](#cite_note-14) \nClenbuterol has also been used as a [performance-enhancing drug](/wiki/Performance-enhancing_drug). One issue is that clenbuterol is a food contaminant in some countries; doping control must distinguish between accidental and deliberate intake.[[15]](#cite_note-15)[[16]](#cite_note-16)\n\nClenbuterol is occasionally referred to as \"bute\" and this risks confusion with [phenylbutazone](/wiki/Phenylbutazone), also called \"bute\". Phenylbutazone, which is a drug also used with horses, was tested for in the [2013 European meat adulteration scandal](/wiki/2013_European_meat_adulteration_scandal).[[17]](#cite_note-fsa-17)\nIntended to result in leaner meat with a higher muscle-to-fat ratio, the use of clenbuterol has been banned in meat since 1991 in the US and since 1996 in the European Union. The drug is banned due to health concerns about symptoms noted in consumers. These include increased heart rate, muscular tremors, headaches, nausea, fever, and chills. In several cases in Europe, these adverse symptoms have been temporary.[[18]](#cite_note-FSIS1995-18)\nClenbuterol is a growth-promoting drug in the [β agonist](/wiki/Beta-adrenergic_agonist) class of compounds. It is not licensed for use in China,[[19]](#cite_note-19) the United States,[[18]](#cite_note-FSIS1995-18) or the EU[[20]](#cite_note-20) for food-producing animals, but some countries have approved it for animals not used for food, and a few countries have approved it for therapeutic uses in food-producing animals.\nNot just athletes are affected by contamination. In Portugal, 50 people were reported as affected by clenbuterol in liver and pork between 1998 and 2002, while in 1990, veal liver was suspected of causing clenbuterol poisoning in 22 people in France and 135 people in Spain.[[21]](#cite_note-21)\nIn September 2006, some 330 people in [Shanghai](/wiki/Shanghai) suffered from [food poisoning](/wiki/Food_poisoning) after eating clenbuterol-contaminated [pork](/wiki/Pork).[[22]](#cite_note-22)\nIn February 2009, at least 70 people in one [Chinese province](/wiki/Chinese_province) ([Guangdong](/wiki/Guangdong)) suffered food poisoning after eating pig organs believed to contain clenbuterol residue. The victims complained of stomach aches and diarrhea after eating pig organs bought in local markets.[[23]](#cite_note-23)\nIn March 2011, [China's Ministry of Agriculture](/wiki/China%27s_Ministry_of_Agriculture) said the government would launch a one-year crackdown on illegal additives in pig feed, after a subsidiary of [Shuanghui Group](/wiki/Shuanghui_Group), China's largest meat producer, was exposed for using clenbuterol-contaminated pork in its meat products. A total of 72 people in central Henan Province, where Shuanghui is based, were taken into police custody for allegedly producing, selling, or using clenbuterol.[[24]](#cite_note-xinhuanet-24) The situation has dramatically improved in China since September 2011, when a ban of clenbuterol was announced by China's Ministry of Agriculture.[[25]](#cite_note-25)\nAuthorities around the world appear to be issuing stricter food safety requirements, such as the [Food Safety Modernization Act](/wiki/Food_Safety_Modernization_Act) in the United States, Canada's revision of their import regulations, China's new food laws published since 2009, South Africa's new food law, and many more global changes and restrictions.\n\nClenbuterol is administered as an aerosol for the treatment of [allergic respiratory disease](/wiki/Recurrent_airway_obstruction) in horses as a [bronchodilator](/wiki/Bronchodilator), and intravenously in cattle to relax the uterus in cows at the time of [parturition](/wiki/Parturition),[[26]](#cite_note-26) specifically to facilitate exteriorisation of the uterus during Caesarian section surgery. It is licensed for obstetrical use in cattle as Planipart Solution for Injection.[[27]](#cite_note-27)\nIt is illegal in some countries to use in livestock used for food.[[28]](#cite_note-28)\n\n- [Mabuterol](/wiki/Mabuterol) (same structure as clenbuterol but one of the chloro groups has been changed to a [trifluoromethyl group](/wiki/Trifluoromethyl_group) instead)\n\n- [Cimaterol](/wiki/Cimaterol)\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-1)** Center for Veterinary Medicine.

          "abstract": "In the context of sport, an ergogenic aid can be broadly defined as a technique or substance used for the purpose of enhancing performance. Ergogenic aids have been classified as nutritional, pharmacologic, physiologic, or psychologic and range from use of accepted techniques such as carbohydrate loading to illegal and unsafe approaches such as anabolic-androgenic steroid use. The efficacy of many of these techniques is controversial, whereas the deleterious side effects are clear. The purpose of this article is to review the epidemiology, administration, efficacy, pharmacology, and side effects of commonly used ergogenic aids. Physical therapists should be able to recognize the signs of ergogenic aid abuse in individuals under their care, and they should be aware of the side effects of these aids. Moreover, the physical therapist can serve as a resource for those individuals seeking information on the risks and benefits of ergogenic aids.",

          "abstract": "Clenbuterol is a recently popular drug used by athletes in many sports for its purported anabolic effects and reduction of subcutaneous fat. It is a beta-2 (beta 2) agonist prescribed overseas as a bronchodilator, but not approved for use in this country. It is on the banned substance list of the United States Olympic Committee. To avoid any erosion of confidence, physicians caring for athletes need accurate information regarding clenbuterol. Such information is unavailable within the routine medical environs. A review of the literature of animal husbandry reveals that this drug, when administered in doses far greater than those required for bronchodilation, does indeed increase the deposition rate of lean mass and retard adipose gain. There are no human studies available. Animal studies were conducted on laboratory and slaughter stock. No investigation into long-term cardiovascular side effects has been undertaken. The rate of extrapolation from animal studies to unsupervised human usage is alarming. If this category of drugs does preserve lean mass in humans, there are legitimate medical applications. Trials of efficacy and safety are needed.",

          "abstract": "Clenbuterol is a potent beta-2 agonist widely misused by professional athletes and bodybuilders. Information on clenbuterol associated adverse events is present in case reports and case series, though it may not be readily available. This systematic review aimed to critically evaluate the evidence of adverse events associated with clenbuterol among athletes. The search strategy was in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched from 1990 to October 2021 to find out the relevant case reports and case series. There were 23 included studies. Using a suitable scale, the included studies' methodological quality analysis was evaluated. In total, 24 athletes experienced adverse events. Oral ingestion of clenbuterol was the most preferred route among them. The daily administered dose of clenbuterol was ranging from 20&#xa0;&#xb5;g to 30&#xa0;mg. Major adverse events experienced by athletes were supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, chest pain, myocardial injury, myocarditis, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, hepatomegaly, hyperglycemia, and death. The cardiac-related complications were the most commonly occurring adverse events. Clenbuterol is notorious to produce life-threatening adverse events including death. Lack of evidence regarding the performance-enhancing effects of clenbuterol combined with its serious toxicities questions the usefulness of this drug in athletes.",

<b>GW-501,516</b>, <b>GW1516</b>, <b>GSK-516</b>, <b>cardarine</b>, and on the black market as <b>endurobol</b>) is a PPARδ receptor agonist that was invented in a collaboration between Ligand Pharmaceuticals and GlaxoSmithKline in the 1990s. It entered into clinical development as a drug candidate for metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, but was abandoned in 2007 because animal testing showed that the drug caused cancer to develop rapidly in several organs. </p><p>In 2007, research was published showing that high doses of GW501516 given to mice dramatically improved their physical performance; the work was widely discussed in popular media, and led to a black market for the drug candidate and to its abuse by athletes as a doping agent. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) developed a test for GW501516 and other related chemicals and added them to the prohibited list in 2009; it has issued additional warnings to athletes that GW501516 is not safe. </p> <meta property=\"mw:PageProp/toc\"> <p>GW501516 was initially discovered during a research collaboration between GSK and Ligand Pharmaceuticals that began in 1992. The discovery of the compound was published in a 2001 issue of <i>PNAS</i>. Oliver <i>et&#160;al.</i> reported that they used \"combinatorial chemistry and structure-based drug design\" to develop it. One of the authors was the son of Leo Sternbach who discovered benzodiazepines in the 1960s. </p><p><i>R &amp; D Focus Drug News</i> reported that GSK began phase I trials of the compound for the treatment of hyperlipidemia in 2000 followed by phase I/II in 2002. In 2003, Ligand Pharmaceuticals earned a $1&#160;million payment as a result of GSK continuing phase I development. </p><p>By 2007, GW501516 had completed two phase II clinical studies and other studies relating to obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease, but GSK abandoned further development of the drug in 2007 for reasons which were not disclosed at the time. It later emerged that the drug was discontinued because animal testing showed that the drug caused cancer to develop rapidly in several organs, at dosages of 3&#160;mg/kg/day in both mice and rats. </p><p>Ronald M. Evans's laboratory purchased a sample of GW501516 and gave mice a much higher dose than had been used in GSK's experiments; they found that the compound dramatically increased the physical performance of the mice. The work was published in 2007 in <i>Cell</i> and was widely reported in the popular press including <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>. </p><p>Another human study (comparing cardarine with the PPARα agonist <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=GW590735&action=edit&redlink=1\" title=\"GW590735 (page does not exist)\">GW590735</a> and placebo) was published in 2021. </p> <div><h3 >Performance-enhancing drug</h3><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=GW501516&action=edit&section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Performance-enhancing drug\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Concerns were raised prior to the 2008 Beijing Olympics that GW501516 could be used by athletes as a performance-enhancing drug that was not currently controlled by regulations or detected by standard tests. One of the main researchers from the study on enhanced endurance consequently developed a urine test to detect the drug, and made it available to the International Olympic Committee. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) developed a test for GW501516 and other related PPARδ modulators, and added such drugs to the prohibited list in 2009. </p><p>GW501516 has been promoted on bodybuilding and athletics websites and by 2011 had already been available for some time on the black market. In 2011, it was reported to cost $1,000 for 10 g. In 2012, WADA recategorised GW501516 from a gene doping compound to a \"hormone and metabolic modulator\". </p><p>In 2013, WADA took the rare step of warning potential users of the compound of the possible health risks, stating that \"clinical approval has not, and will not be given for this substance\"; the <i>New Scientist</i> attributed the warning to the risks of the drug causing cancer. </p><p>A number of athletes have tested positive for GW501516. At the Vuelta Ciclista a Costa Rica in December 2012, four Costa Rican riders tested positive for GW501516. Three of them received two-year suspensions, while the fourth received 12 years as it was his second doping violation. In April 2013, Russian cyclist Valery Kaykov was suspended by cycling's governing body UCI after having tested positive for GW501516. Kaykov's team RusVelo dismissed him immediately and in May 2013, Venezuelan Miguel Ubeto was provisionally suspended by the Lampre team. In February 2014, Russian race walker Elena Lashmanova tested positive for GW501516. In April 2019, American heavyweight boxer Jarrell Miller tested positive for GW501516 which caused his challenge for Anthony Joshua's World Heavyweight titles to be cancelled. In December 2020, Miller was suspended for 2 years for repeated violations. In July 2022, the 2012 800&#160;m Olympic silver medalist from Botswana, Nijel Amos tested positive for GW501516 and was provisionally suspended just days before the 2022 World Athletics Championships. Surinam's Issam Asinga, who set the under-20 world track record in the men's 100 meters, was informed on Aug. 9, 2023 by the Athletics Integrity Unit that his July 18 drug test the prior month detected trace amounts of GW501516. Asinga has alleged in a suit filed in the Southern District of New York that Gatorade provided him with Gatorade Recovery Gummies at their awards ceremony one week earlier in Los Angeles tainted with GW501516. </p> <div><h2 >Mechanism of action</h2><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=GW501516&action=edit&section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Mechanism of action\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>GW501516 is a selective agonist of the PPARδ receptor. It displays high affinity (K<sub>i</sub> = 1 nM) and potency (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1 nM) for PPARδ with greater than 1,000-fold selectivity over PPARα and PPARγ. </p><p>In rats, binding of GW501516 to PPARδ recruits the coactivator PGC-1α. The PPARδ/coactivator complex in turn upregulates the expression of proteins involved in energy expenditure. Furthermore, in rats treated with GW501516, increased fatty acid metabolism in skeletal muscle and protection against diet-induced obesity and type II diabetes was observed. In obese rhesus monkeys, GW501516 increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and lowered very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). </p><p>Activation of PPARδ is also believed to be the mechanism responsible for cancer induction. A 2018 study in finds that GW501516 enhances the growth of colitis-associated colorectal cancer by increasing inflammation and the expression of GLUT1 and SLC1A5. </p> <ul><li>Acadesine</li> <li>GFT505</li> <li>GW0742</li> <li>Irisin</li> <li>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor</li> <li>Sodelglitazar</li> <li>SR9009</li></ul> <div> <ol> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-convo_1-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-convo_1-1\"></a> <cite >Koh B (2013-03-22). <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theconversation.com/anti-doping-agency-warns-cheats-on-the-health-risks-of-endurobol-12997\">\"Anti-doping agency warns cheats on the health risks of Endurobol\"</a>.

It entered into clinical development as a drug candidate for [metabolic](/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome) and [cardiovascular diseases](/wiki/Cardiovascular_diseases), but was abandoned in 2007 because [animal testing](/wiki/Animal_testing) showed that the drug caused cancer to develop rapidly in several organs.[[2]](#cite_note-Sahebkar2014rev-2)\nIn 2007, research was published showing that high doses of GW501516 given to mice dramatically improved their physical performance; the work was widely discussed in popular media, and led to a black market for the drug candidate and to its abuse by athletes as a [doping agent](/wiki/Performance-enhancing_drugs). The [World Anti-Doping Agency](/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency) (WADA) developed a test for GW501516 and other related chemicals and added them to the prohibited list in 2009; it has issued additional warnings to athletes that GW501516 is not safe.\n\nGW501516 was initially discovered during a research collaboration between [GSK](/wiki/GlaxoSmithKline) and [Ligand Pharmaceuticals](/wiki/Ligand_Pharmaceuticals) that began in 1992.[[3]](#cite_note-3) The discovery of the compound was published in a 2001 issue of *[PNAS](/wiki/PNAS)*.[[4]](#cite_note-pmid14677574-4) Oliver *et&#160;al.* reported that they used \"[combinatorial chemistry](/wiki/Combinatorial_chemistry) and [structure-based drug design](/wiki/Structure-based_drug_design)\" to develop it.[[5]](#cite_note-pmid11309497-5) One of the authors was the son of [Leo Sternbach](/wiki/Leo_Sternbach) who discovered [benzodiazepines](/wiki/Benzodiazepine) in the 1960s.[[6]](#cite_note-flynn-6)\n*R & D Focus Drug News* reported that GSK began [phase I trials](/wiki/Phase_I_trials) of the compound for the treatment of [hyperlipidemia](/wiki/Hyperlipidemia) in 2000[[7]](#cite_note-7) followed by phase I/II in 2002.[[8]](#cite_note-8) In 2003, Ligand Pharmaceuticals earned a $1&#160;million payment as a result of GSK continuing phase I development.[[9]](#cite_note-9)\nBy 2007, GW501516 had completed two phase II clinical studies and other studies relating to [obesity](/wiki/Obesity), [diabetes](/wiki/Diabetes), [dyslipidemia](/wiki/Dyslipidemia), and [cardiovascular disease](/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease),[[10]](#cite_note-Barish_2006-10)[[11]](#cite_note-dressel-11) but GSK abandoned further development of the drug in 2007 for reasons which were not disclosed at the time.[[12]](#cite_note-pmid18808307-12) It later emerged that the drug was discontinued because [animal testing](/wiki/Animal_testing) showed that the drug caused cancer to develop rapidly in several organs, at dosages of 3&#160;mg/kg/day in both mice and rats.[[2]](#cite_note-Sahebkar2014rev-2)[[13]](#cite_note-13)[[14]](#cite_note-14)\n[Ronald M. Evans](/wiki/Ronald_M._Evans)'s laboratory purchased a sample of GW501516 and gave mice a much higher dose than had been used in GSK's experiments; they found that the compound dramatically increased the physical performance of the mice.[[15]](#cite_note-15) The work was published in 2007 in *[Cell](/wiki/Cell_(journal))* and was widely reported in the popular press including *The New York Times* and *The Wall Street Journal*.[[16]](#cite_note-behar-16)\nAnother human study (comparing cardarine with the PPARα agonist [GW590735](/w/index.php?title=GW590735&action=edit&redlink=1) and placebo) was published in 2021.[[17]](#cite_note-17)\n\n### Performance-enhancing drug\n\nConcerns were raised prior to the [2008 Beijing Olympics](/wiki/2008_Beijing_Olympics) that GW501516 could be used by athletes as a [performance-enhancing drug](/wiki/Performance-enhancing_drug) that was not currently controlled by regulations or detected by standard tests. One of the main researchers from the study on enhanced endurance consequently developed a urine test to detect the drug, and made it available to the [International Olympic Committee](/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee). The [World Anti-Doping Agency](/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency) (WADA) developed a test for GW501516 and other related [PPARδ](/wiki/Peroxisome_proliferator-activated_receptor_delta) modulators,[[18]](#cite_note-The_Independent-18) and added such drugs to the prohibited list in 2009.[[19]](#cite_note-19)\nGW501516 has been promoted on [bodybuilding](/wiki/Bodybuilding) and athletics websites[[20]](#cite_note-newsci-20) and by 2011 had already been available for some time on the [black market](/wiki/Black_market).[[1]](#cite_note-convo-1)[[21]](#cite_note-pmid21538997-21) In 2011, it was reported to cost $1,000 for 10 g.[[16]](#cite_note-behar-16)  In 2012, WADA recategorised GW501516 from a [gene doping](/wiki/Gene_doping) compound to a \"hormone and metabolic modulator\".[[22]](#cite_note-pmid22130396-22)\nIn 2013, WADA took the rare step of warning potential users of the compound of the possible health risks, stating that \"clinical approval has not, and will not be given for this substance\"; the *[New Scientist](/wiki/New_Scientist)* attributed the warning to the risks of the drug causing cancer.[[20]](#cite_note-newsci-20)[[23]](#cite_note-wada13-23)\nA number of athletes have tested positive for GW501516.  At the [Vuelta Ciclista a Costa Rica](/wiki/Vuelta_Ciclista_a_Costa_Rica) in December 2012, four Costa Rican riders tested positive for GW501516. Three of them received two-year suspensions, while the fourth received 12 years as it was his second doping violation.[[24]](#cite_note-24)[[25]](#cite_note-25)[[26]](#cite_note-26)  In April 2013, Russian cyclist [Valery Kaykov](/wiki/Valery_Kaykov) was suspended by cycling's governing body [UCI](/wiki/Union_Cycliste_Internationale) after having tested positive for GW501516. Kaykov's team [RusVelo](/wiki/RusVelo) dismissed him immediately[[27]](#cite_note-27) and in May 2013, Venezuelan [Miguel Ubeto](/wiki/Miguel_Ubeto) was provisionally suspended by the Lampre team.[[28]](#cite_note-28)  In February 2014, Russian race walker [Elena Lashmanova](/wiki/Elena_Lashmanova) tested positive for GW501516.[[29]](#cite_note-List20140626-29)[[30]](#cite_note-30) In April 2019, American heavyweight boxer [Jarrell Miller](/wiki/Jarrell_Miller) tested positive for GW501516 which caused his challenge for [Anthony Joshua](/wiki/Anthony_Joshua)'s World Heavyweight titles to be cancelled.[[31]](#cite_note-31) In December 2020, Miller was suspended for 2 years for repeated violations.[[32]](#cite_note-32) In July 2022, the 2012 800&#160;m Olympic silver medalist from Botswana, [Nijel Amos](/wiki/Nijel_Amos) tested positive for GW501516 and was provisionally suspended just days before the [2022 World Athletics Championships](/wiki/2022_World_Athletics_Championships).[[33]](#cite_note-33) Surinam's [Issam Asinga](/wiki/Issam_Asinga), who set the under-20 world track record in the men's 100 meters, was informed on Aug. 9, 2023 by the [Athletics Integrity Unit](/wiki/Athletics_Integrity_Unit) that his July 18 drug test the prior month detected trace amounts of GW501516. Asinga has alleged in a suit filed in the Southern District of New York that [Gatorade](/wiki/Gatorade) provided him with Gatorade Recovery Gummies at their awards ceremony one week earlier in Los Angeles tainted with GW501516.[[34]](#cite_note-34)\n\n## Mechanism of action\n\nGW501516 is a selective [agonist](/wiki/Agonist) of the [PPARδ](/wiki/Peroxisome_proliferator-activated_receptor_delta) receptor.[[35]](#cite_note-pmid16625823-35) It displays high affinity (Ki = 1 nM) and potency (EC50 = 1 nM) for PPARδ with greater than 1,000-fold selectivity over [PPARα](/wiki/PPAR%CE%B1) and [PPARγ](/wiki/PPAR%CE%B3).[[5]](#cite_note-pmid11309497-5)\nIn rats, binding of GW501516 to PPARδ recruits the [coactivator](/wiki/Coactivator_(genetics)) [PGC-1α](/wiki/PPARGC1A).  The PPARδ/coactivator complex in turn upregulates the expression of proteins involved in energy expenditure.[[36]](#cite_note-Sprecher_2007-36)  Furthermore, in rats treated with GW501516, increased fatty acid metabolism in skeletal muscle and protection against diet-induced obesity and [type II diabetes](/wiki/Type_II_diabetes) was observed.  In obese rhesus monkeys, GW501516 increased [high-density lipoprotein](/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein) (HDL) and lowered [very-low-density lipoprotein](/wiki/Very-low-density_lipoprotein) (VLDL).[[36]](#cite_note-Sprecher_2007-36)\nActivation of PPARδ is also believed to be the mechanism responsible for cancer induction. A 2018 study in finds that GW501516 enhances the growth of [colitis](/wiki/Colitis)-associated [colorectal cancer](/wiki/Colorectal_cancer) by increasing inflammation and the expression of [GLUT1](/wiki/GLUT1) and [SLC1A5](/wiki/SLC1A5).[[37]](#cite_note-37)\n\n- [Acadesine](/wiki/Acadesine)\n\n- [GFT505](/wiki/GFT505)\n\n- [GW0742](/wiki/GW0742)\n\n- [Irisin](/wiki/Irisin)\n\n- [Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor](/wiki/Peroxisome_proliferator-activated_receptor)\n\n- [Sodelglitazar](/wiki/Sodelglitazar)\n\n- [SR9009](/wiki/SR9009)\n\n^ [***a***](#cite_ref-convo_1-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-convo_1-1) Koh B (2013-03-22).

          "abstract": "Previous reports have shown that PPAR&#x3b2;/&#x3b4; agonists ameliorate insulin resistance associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). To determine the role of PPAR&#x3b2;/&#x3b4; in tumor necrosis factor &#x3b1; (TNF&#x3b1;)-mediated insulin resistance, we investigated expression levels of adiponectin and insulin receptor (IR) in response to treatment with the PPAR&#x3b2;/&#x3b4; agonist GW501516 with or without TNF&#x3b1;, a proinflammatory cytokine, in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. GW501516 induced adipocyte differentiation and the expression of adiponectin in a dose-dependent manner in differentiated adipocytes. TNF&#x3b1; treatment reduced adiponectin expression at the end of differentiation. This effect was reversed by GW501516 co-treatment with TNF&#x3b1;. TNF&#x3b1; treatment decreased adipogenic marker genes such as PPAR&#x3b3;, aP2, resistin, and GLUT4, and GW501516 reversed the effects of TNF&#x3b1;. GW501516 treatment increased the expression of insulin receptor and inhibited TNF&#x3b1;-mediated repression of insulin receptor. Our results showed that GW501516 abrogated TNF&#x3b1;-induced insulin resistance. In summary, our study demonstrated that the PPAR&#x3b2;/&#x3b4; agonist, GW501516 reversed TNF&#x3b1;-induced decreases in adipocyte differentiation and adiponectin expression, and improved insulin sensitivity by increasing the expression of insulin receptor. Therefore, PPAR&#x3b4; may be a promising therapeutic target for treatment of insulin resistance in patients with T2DM.",

          "abstract": "The development of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-beta/delta (PPARbeta/delta) ligands for the treatment of diseases including metabolic syndrome, diabetes and obesity has been hampered due to contradictory findings on their potential safety. For example, while some reports show that ligand activation of PPARbeta/delta promotes the induction of terminal differentiation and inhibition of cell growth, other reports suggest that PPARbeta/delta ligands potentiate tumorigenesis by increasing cell proliferation. Some of the contradictory findings could be due in part to differences in the ligand examined, the presence or absence of serum in cell cultures, differences in cell lines or differences in the method used to quantify cell growth. For these reasons, this study examined the effect of ligand activation of PPARbeta/delta on cell growth of two human cancer cell lines, MCF7 (breast cancer) and UACC903 (melanoma) in the presence or absence of serum using two highly specific PPARbeta/delta ligands, GW0742 or GW501516. Culturing cells in the presence of either GW0742 or GW501516 caused upregulation of the known PPARbeta/delta target gene angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4). Inhibition of cell growth was observed in both cell lines cultured in the presence of either GW0742 or GW501516, and the presence or absence of serum had little influence on this inhibition. Results from the present studies demonstrate that ligand activation of PPARbeta/delta inhibits the growth of both MCF7 and UACC903 cell lines and provide further evidence that PPARbeta/delta ligands are not mitogenic in human cancer cell lines.",

          "abstract": "This study addressed the effects of nandrolone decanoate (ND) on contractile properties and muscle fiber characteristics of rats submitted to swimming. Male Wistar rats were grouped in sedentary (S), swimming (Sw), sedentary+ND (SND), and swimming+ND (SwND), six animals per group. ND (3 mg/kg) was injected (subcutaneously) 5 days/week, for 4 weeks. Swimming consisted of 60-min sessions (load 2%), 5 days/week, for 4 weeks. After this period, the sciatic nerve extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle was isolated for myographic recordings. Fatigue resistance was assessed by the percent (%) decline of 180 direct tetanic contractions (30 Hz). Safety margin of synaptic transmission was determined from the resistance to the blockade of indirectly evoked twitches (0.5 Hz) induced by pancuronium (5 to 9x10(-7) M). EDL muscles were also submitted to histological and histochemical analysis (haematoxylin-eosin (HE); nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR)). Significant differences were detected by two-way ANOVA (p&lt;0.05). ND did not change body mass, fatigue resistance or kinetic properties of indirect twitches in either sedentary or swimming rats. In contrast, ND reduced the safety margin of synaptic transmission in sedentary animals (SND=53.3+/-4.7% vs. S=75.7+/-2.0%), but did not affect the safety margin in the swimming rats (SwND=75.81+/-3.1% vs. Sw=71.0+/-4.0%). No significant difference in fiber type proportions or diameters was observed in EDL muscle of any experimental group. These results indicate that ND does not act as an ergogenic reinforcement in rats submitted to 4 weeks of swimming. On the other hand, this study revealed an important toxic effect of ND, that it reduces the safety margin of synaptic transmission in sedentary animals. Such an effect is masked when associated with physical exercise.",

Twenty-one men with idiopathic osteoporosis (as determined by radiological and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry findings) were randomly allocated to either 50 mg nandrolone decanoate intramuscularly (im) weekly and 1,000 mg oral calcium carbonate daily (NDC group) or to 1,000 mg oral calcium carbonate daily (CAL group). Bone densitometry (total body, left femur, and lumbar spine), serum, and urine biochemical parameters were measured at 3-month intervals. In the NDC group, bone mineral density initially increased, reached a plateau, and then decreased to near baseline levels at 12 months. Increases in lean muscle mass mirrored these changes. Free and total testosterone significantly decreased. Hemoglobin increased in all patients in this group. Patients in the CAL group exhibited no significant change in either total body or bone mineral density or biochemical parameters. Thus, nandrolone decanoate, 50 mg im weekly, transiently increases the bone mass of men with idiopathic osteoporosis in this preliminary study. Careful monitoring is necessary.",

In particular, both amphetamine and β-methylphenethylamine are human TAAR1 agonists. In appearance, it is a colorless or yellowish liquid. </p><p>Relatively little information has been published about this substance. Hartung and Munch reported that it had good antihypotensive (pressor) activity in experimental animals, and that it was orally active. The MLD (minimum lethal dose) for the HCl salt was given as 500&#160;mg/kg (rat, s.c.) and 50&#160;mg/kg (rabbit, i.v.). </p><p>A study by Graham and co-workers at the Upjohn Co., comparing many β-methylphenethylamines substituted on the benzene ring showed that β-methylphenethylamine itself had 1/700 x the pressor activity of epinephrine, corresponding to ~ 1/3 the potency of amphetamine. The β-methyl compound also had ~ 2 x the broncho-dilating power of amphetamine (as measured using the isolated rabbit lung), and an LD<sub>50</sub> of 50&#160;mg/kg (rat, i.v.). </p> <meta property=\"mw:PageProp/toc\"> <p>β-Methylphenethylamine can be made by the catalytic hydrogenation of 2-phenylpropionitrile with Pd/C in pure anhydrous ethanol containing three equivalents of HCl; the finished product is extracted as the HCl salt, m.p.&#160;123-124°. </p> <p>In 2015, 52% of supplements labeled as containing <i>Acacia rigidula</i> were found to contain BMPEA. Consumers following recommended maximum daily servings would consume a maximum of 94&#160;mg of BMPEA per day. In 2012, however, the FDA determined that BMPEA was not naturally present in <i>Acacia rigidula</i> leaves. This question was litigated during the trial of <i>Hi Tech Pharmaceuticals Inc vs. Cohen</i>. Despite US Food and Drug Administration warning letters, BMPEA remains present in dietary supplements. </p> <p>β-Methylphenethylamine was associated with a case of cerebral hemorrhage in a Swedish athlete and first time user. The female victim with no medical history had taken a Swedish food supplement with 290&#160;mg β-methylphenethylamine per serving before commencing her usual exercises. After about 30 minutes the first symptoms appeared. The presence of the active ingredient was not declared on the label. Use of β-Methylphenethylamine is also prohibited in sports. </p> <ul><li>Amphetamine</li> <li>β-Methylamphetamine</li> <li>Phenethylamine</li> <li>Phenpromethamine (<i>N</i>-methyl-β-methylphenethylamine)</li> <li><a href=\"/wiki/%CE%92,N,N-Trimethylphenethylamine\" title=\"Β,N,N-Trimethylphenethylamine\">β,<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-Trimethylphenethylamine</a></li> <li>Phenylpropylamine</li></ul> <div><ol> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b> <cite><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230326151141/https://www.fda.gov/food/dietary-supplement-ingredient-directory/bmpea-dietary-supplements\">\"BMPEA in Dietary Supplements\"</a>. <i>FDA</i>. 22 February 2023.

In particular, both amphetamine and β-methylphenethylamine are human [TAAR1](/wiki/TAAR1) agonists.[[2]](#cite_note-pmid17038507-2) In appearance, it is a colorless or yellowish liquid.\nRelatively little information has been published about this substance. Hartung and Munch reported that it had good [antihypotensive](/wiki/Antihypotensive_agent) (pressor) activity in experimental animals, and that it was orally active. The MLD (minimum lethal dose) for the HCl salt was given as 500&#160;mg/kg (rat, s.c.) and 50&#160;mg/kg (rabbit, i.v.).[[3]](#cite_note-Hartung-3)\nA study by Graham and co-workers at the Upjohn Co., comparing many β-methylphenethylamines substituted on the benzene ring showed that β-methylphenethylamine itself had 1/700 x the pressor activity of [epinephrine](/wiki/Epinephrine), corresponding to ~ 1/3 the potency of amphetamine. The β-methyl compound also had ~ 2 x the broncho-dilating power of amphetamine (as measured using the isolated rabbit lung), and an LD50 of 50&#160;mg/kg (rat, i.v.).[[4]](#cite_note-4)\n\nβ-Methylphenethylamine can be made by the [catalytic](/wiki/Catalytic) [hydrogenation](/wiki/Hydrogenation) of 2-phenylpropionitrile with [Pd/C](/wiki/Pd/C) in pure anhydrous ethanol containing three equivalents of HCl; the finished product is extracted as the HCl salt, m.p.&#160;123-124°.[[3]](#cite_note-Hartung-3)\n\nIn 2015, 52% of supplements labeled as containing *[Acacia rigidula](/wiki/Acacia_rigidula)* were found to contain BMPEA.[[5]](#cite_note-cohen2015-5)[[6]](#cite_note-6) Consumers following recommended maximum daily servings would consume a maximum of 94&#160;mg of BMPEA per day.[[5]](#cite_note-cohen2015-5) In 2012, however, the FDA determined that BMPEA was not naturally present in *Acacia rigidula* leaves.[[7]](#cite_note-7) This question was litigated during the trial of *Hi Tech Pharmaceuticals Inc vs. Cohen*.[[8]](#cite_note-8)[[9]](#cite_note-9)  Despite US Food and Drug Administration warning letters, BMPEA remains present in dietary supplements.[[10]](#cite_note-10)\n\nβ-Methylphenethylamine was associated with a case of cerebral hemorrhage in a Swedish athlete and first time user. The female victim with no medical history had taken a Swedish [food supplement](/wiki/Food_supplement) with 290&#160;mg β-methylphenethylamine per serving before commencing her usual exercises. After about 30 minutes the first symptoms appeared. The presence of the active ingredient was not declared on the label.[[11]](#cite_note-Cohen-11) Use of β-Methylphenethylamine is also prohibited in sports.[[12]](#cite_note-Cholbinski-12)\n\n- [Amphetamine](/wiki/Amphetamine)\n\n- [β-Methylamphetamine](/wiki/2-Phenyl-3-aminobutane)\n\n- [Phenethylamine](/wiki/Phenethylamine)\n\n- [Phenpromethamine](/wiki/Phenpromethamine) (*N*-methyl-β-methylphenethylamine)\n\n- [β,*N*,*N*-Trimethylphenethylamine](/wiki/%CE%92,N,N-Trimethylphenethylamine)\n\n- [Phenylpropylamine](/wiki/Phenylpropylamine)\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-1)** [\"BMPEA in Dietary Supplements\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20230326151141/https://www.fda.gov/food/dietary-supplement-ingredient-directory/bmpea-dietary-supplements). *[FDA](/wiki/FDA)*. 22 February 2023.

          "abstract": "&#x3b2;-Methylphenethylamine [(BMPEA), 2-phenylpropan-1-amine] is a structural isomer of amphetamine (1-phenylpropan-2-amine) that has been identified in preworkout and weight loss supplements, yet little information is available about its pharmacology. Here, the neurochemical and cardiovascular effects of BMPEA and its analogs, N-methyl-2-phenylpropan-1-amine (MPPA) and N,N-dimethyl-2-phenylpropan-1-amine (DMPPA), were compared with structurally related amphetamines. As expected, amphetamine and methamphetamine were potent substrate-type releasing agents at dopamine transporters (DATs) and norepinephrine transporters (NETs) in rat brain synaptosomes. BMPEA and MPPA were also substrates at DATs and NETs, but they were at least 10-fold less potent than amphetamine. DMPPA was a weak substrate only at NETs. Importantly, the releasing actions of BMPEA and MPPA were more potent at NETs than DATs. Amphetamine produced significant dose-related increases in blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and locomotor activity in conscious rats fitted with surgically implanted biotelemetry transmitters. BMPEA, MPPA, and DMPPA produced increases in BP that were similar to the effects of amphetamine, but the compounds failed to substantially affect HR or activity. The hypertensive effect of BMPEA was reversed by the &#x3b1;-adrenergic antagonist prazosin but not the ganglionic blocker chlorisondamine. Radioligand binding at various G protein-coupled receptors did not identify nontransporter sites of action that could account for cardiovascular effects of BMPEA or its analogs. Our results show that BMPEA, MPPA, and DMPPA are biologically active. The compounds are unlikely to be abused due to weak effects at DATs, but they could produce adverse cardiovascular effects via substrate activity at peripheral NET sites.",

          "abstract": "Novel substances of expected doping activity are constantly introduced to the market. &#x3b2;-Methylphenethylamine (BMPEA) is classified as a doping agent by the World Anti-Doping Agency as it is a positional isomer of amphetamine. In this work, the development and application of a simple and rapid analytical procedure that enables discrimination between both isomers is described. The analytes of interest were extracted from urine by a two-step liquid-liquid extraction and then analyzed by UPLC/MS/MS under isocratic conditions. The entire analytical procedure was validated by evaluating its selectivity, discrimination capabilities, carry-over, sensitivity, and influence of matrix effects on its performance. Application of the method resulted in detection of BMPEA in eight anti-doping samples, including the first report of adverse analytical finding regarding its use. Further analysis showed that BMPEA may be eliminated unchanged along with its phase II conjugates, the hydrolysis of which may considerably improve detection capabilities of the method. Omission of the hydrolysis step may therefore, produce false-negative results. Testing laboratories should also carefully examine their LC/MS/MS-based amphetamine and BMPEA findings as both isomers fragment yielding comparable collision-induced dissociation spectra and their insufficient chromatographic separation may result in misidentification. This is of great importance in case of forensic analyses as BMPEA is not controlled by the public law, and its manufacturing, distribution, and use are legal.",

<b>Stablon</b>, <b>Tatinol</b>, and <b>Coaxil</b> among others, is an atypical tricyclic antidepressant which is used mainly in the treatment of major depressive disorder, although it may also be used to treat anxiety, asthma, and irritable bowel syndrome. </p><p>Tianeptine has antidepressant and anxiolytic effects with a relative lack of sedative, anticholinergic, and cardiovascular side effects. It has been found to act as an atypical agonist of the μ-opioid receptor with clinically negligible effects on the δ- and κ-opioid receptors. This may explain part of its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects; however, it is thought that tianeptine also modulates glutamate receptors, and this may also explain tianeptine's antidepressant/anxiolytic effects. </p><p>Tianeptine was discovered and patented by the French Society of Medical Research in the 1960s. It was introduced for medical use in France in 1983. Currently, tianeptine is approved in France and manufactured and marketed by Laboratories Servier SA; it is also marketed in a number of other European countries under the trade name Coaxil as well as in Asia (including Singapore) and Latin America as Stablon and Tatinol but it is not available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Italy or the United Kingdom. In the US, it is an unregulated drug sold under several names and some of these products have been found to be adulterated with other recreational drugs. It is commonly known by the nickname \"gas station heroin\". </p> <div><h3 >Depression and anxiety</h3><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Tianeptine&action=edit&section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Depression and anxiety\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Tianeptine shows efficacy against serious depressive episodes (major depression), comparable to amitriptyline, imipramine and fluoxetine, but with significantly fewer side effects. It was shown to be more effective than maprotiline in a group of people with co-existing depression and anxiety. Tianeptine also displays significant anxiolytic properties and is useful in treating a spectrum of anxiety disorders including panic disorder, as evidenced by a study in which those administered 35% <a href=\"/wiki/Carbon_dioxide\" title=\"Carbon dioxide\">CO<sub>2</sub></a> gas (carbogen) on paroxetine or tianeptine therapy showed equivalent panic-blocking effects. Like many antidepressants (including bupropion, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, moclobemide and numerous others) it may also have a beneficial effect on cognition in people with depression-induced cognitive dysfunction. A 2005 study in Egypt showed tianeptine to be effective in men with depression and erectile dysfunction. </p><p>Tianeptine has been found to be effective in depression, in people with Parkinson's disease, and with post-traumatic stress disorder for which it was as safe and effective as fluoxetine and moclobemide. </p> <p>A clinical trial comparing its efficacy and tolerability with amitriptyline in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome showed that tianeptine was at least as effective as amitriptyline and produced fewer prominent adverse effects, such as dry mouth and constipation. </p><p>Tianeptine has been reported to be very effective for asthma. In August 1998, Dr. Fuad Lechin and colleagues at the Central University of Venezuela Institute of Experimental Medicine in Caracas published the results of a 52-week randomized controlled trial of asthmatic children; the children in the groups who received tianeptine had a sharp decrease in clinical rating and increased lung function. Two years earlier, they had found a close, positive association between free serotonin in plasma and severity of asthma in symptomatic persons. As tianeptine was the only agent known to both reduce free serotonin in plasma and enhance uptake in platelets, they decided to use it to see if reducing free serotonin levels in plasma would help. By November 2004, there had been two double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trials and an under-25,000 person open-label study lasting over seven years, both showing effectiveness. </p><p>Tianeptine also has anticonvulsant and analgesic effects, and a clinical trial in Spain that ended in January 2007 has shown that tianeptine is effective in treating pain due to fibromyalgia. Tianeptine has been shown to have efficacy with minimal side effects in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. </p> <p>Known contraindications include the following: </p> <ul><li>Hypersensitivity to tianeptine or any of the tablet's excipients.</li></ul> <p>Compared to other tricyclic antidepressants, it produces significantly fewer cardiovascular, anticholinergic (like dry mouth or constipation), sedative and appetite-stimulating effects. Unlike other tricyclic antidepressants, tianeptine does not affect heart function. </p><p>μ-Opioid receptor agonists can sometimes induce euphoria, as does tianeptine, occasionally, at high doses, well above the normal therapeutic range (see <a href=\"#Recreational_use\">§&#160;Recreational use</a> below). Tianeptine can also cause severe withdrawal symptoms after prolonged use at high doses which should prompt extreme caution. </p> <p><i>Sources:</i> </p> <dl><dt>Common (&gt;1% frequency)</dt></dl>

It was also found to act as a full agonist of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR), although with approximately 200-fold lower potency. The same researchers subsequently found that the MOR is required for the acute and chronic antidepressant-like behavioral effects of tianeptine in mice and that its primary metabolite had similar activity as a MOR agonist but with a much longer elimination half-life. Moreover, in mice, although tianeptine produced other opioid-like behavioral effects such as analgesia and reward, it did not result in tolerance or withdrawal. The authors suggested that tianeptine may be acting as a biased agonist of the MOR and that this may be responsible for its atypical profile as a MOR agonist. However, there are reports that suggest that withdrawal effects resembling those of other typical opioid drugs (including but not limited to depression, insomnia, and cold/flu-like symptoms) do manifest following prolonged use at dosages far beyond the medical range. In addition to its therapeutic effects, activation of the MOR is likely to also be responsible for the abuse potential of tianeptine at high doses that are well above the normal therapeutic range and efficacy threshold. </p><p>In rats, when co-administered with morphine, tianeptine prevents morphine-induced respiratory depression without impairing analgesia. In humans, however, tianeptine was found to increase respiratory depression when administered in conjunction with the potent opioid remifentanil. </p> <div><h4 >Glutamatergic, neurotrophic, and neuroplastic modulation</h4><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Tianeptine&action=edit&section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Glutamatergic, neurotrophic, and neuroplastic modulation\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Research suggests that tianeptine produces its antidepressant effects through indirect alteration and inhibition of glutamate receptor activity (i.e., AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors) and release of <a href=\"/wiki/Brain-derived_neurotrophic_factor\" title=\"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor\"><abbr title=\"brain-derived neurotrophic factor\">BDNF</abbr></a>Tooltip brain-derived neurotrophic factor, in turn affecting neural plasticity. Some researchers hypothesize that tianeptine has a protective effect against stress induced neuronal remodeling. There is also action on the NMDA and AMPA receptors. In animal models, tianeptine inhibits the pathological stress-induced changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission in the amygdala and hippocampus. It may also facilitate signal transduction at the CA3 commissural associational synapse by altering the phosphorylation state of glutamate receptors. With the discovery of the rapid and novel antidepressant effects of drugs such as ketamine, many believe the efficacy of antidepressants is related to promotion of synaptic plasticity. This may be achieved by regulating the excitatory amino acid systems that are responsible for changes in the strength of synaptic connections as well as enhancing BDNF expression, although these findings are based largely on preclinical studies. </p> <div><h4 >Serotonin reuptake enhancer</h4><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Tianeptine&action=edit&section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Serotonin reuptake enhancer\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Tianeptine is no longer labelled a selective serotonin reuptake enhancer (SSRE) antidepressant. Tianeptine had been found to bind to the same allosteric site on the serotonin transporter (SERT) as conventional TCAs. However, whereas conventional TCAs inhibit serotonin reuptake by the SERT, tianeptine appeared to enhance it. This seems to be because of the unique C3 amino heptanoic acid side chain of tianeptine, which, in contrast to other TCAs, is thought to lock the SERT in a conformation that increases affinity for and reuptake (<a href=\"/wiki/Michaelis%E2%80%93Menten_kinetics\" title=\"Michaelis–Menten kinetics\">V<sub>max</sub></a>) of serotonin. As such, tianeptine was thought to act a positive allosteric modulator of the SERT, or as a \"serotonin reuptake enhancer\". </p><p>Although tianeptine was originally found to have no effect <i>in vitro</i> on monoamine reuptake, release, or receptor binding, upon acute and repeated administration, tianeptine decreased the extracellular levels of serotonin in rat brain without a decrease in serotonin release, leading to a theory of tianeptine enhancing serotonin reuptake. The (−)-enantiomer is more active in this sense than the (+)-enantiomer. However, more recent studies found that long-term administration of tianeptine does not elicit any marked alterations (neither increases nor decreases) in extracellular levels of serotonin in rats. However, coadministration of tianeptine and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine inhibited the effect of tianeptine on long-term potentiation in hippocampal CA1 area. This is considered an argument for the opposite effects of tianeptine and fluoxetine on serotonin uptake, although it has been shown that fluoxetine can be partially substituted for tianeptine in animal studies. In any case, the collective research suggests that direct modulation of the serotonin system is unlikely to be the mechanism of action underlying the antidepressant effects of tianeptine. </p> <p>Tianeptine modestly enhances the mesolimbic release of dopamine and potentiates CNS <a href=\"/wiki/Dopamine_D2_receptor\" title=\"Dopamine D2 receptor\">D<sub>2</sub></a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Dopamine_D3_receptor\" title=\"Dopamine D3 receptor\">D<sub>3</sub> receptors</a>. Tianeptine has no affinity for the dopamine transporter or the dopamine receptors. CREB-TF (CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein) is a cellular transcription factor. It binds to certain DNA sequences called cAMP response elements (CRE), thereby increasing or decreasing the transcription of the genes. CREB has a well-documented role in neuronal plasticity and long-term memory formation in the brain. Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript, also known as CART, is a neuropeptide protein that in humans is encoded by the <i>CARTPT</i> gene. CART appears to have roles in reward, feeding, stress, and it has the functional properties of an endogenous psychostimulant. Taking into account that CART production is upregulated by CREB, it could be hypothesized that due to tianeptine's central role in BDNF and neuronal plasticity, this CREB may be the transcription cascade through which this drug enhances mesolimbic release of dopamine. </p><p>Research indicates possible anticonvulsant (anti-seizure) and analgesic (painkilling) activity of tianeptine via downstream modulation of adenosine <a href=\"/wiki/Adenosine_A1_receptor\" title=\"Adenosine A1 receptor\">A<sub>1</sub> receptors</a> (as the effects could be experimentally blocked by antagonists of this receptor). Tianpetine is also weak histone deacetylase inhibitor and analogs with increased potency and selectivity are developed. </p><p>Tianeptine has been shown to be a high-efficacy agonist of PPAR-delta, a nuclear receptor. </p> <p>The bioavailability of tianeptine is approximately 99%. Its plasma protein binding is about 95%. The metabolism of tianeptine is hepatic, via β-oxidation. CYP enzymes are not involved, which limits the potential for drug-drug interactions. Maximal concentration is reached in about an hour and the elimination half-life is 2.5 to 3&#160;hours. The elimination half-life has been found to be increased to 4 to 9&#160;hours in the elderly. Tianeptine is usually packaged as a sodium salt but can also be found as tianeptine sulfate, a slower-releasing formulation patented by Janssen in 2012. In 2022 Tonix Pharmaceuticals received permission from the US FDA to conduct phase II clinical trials on tianeptine hemioxalate extended-release tablets designed for once-daily use. The project was discontinued in late 2023 because of disappointing results in clinical trials. </p><p>Tianeptine has two active metabolites, MC5 (a pentanoic acid derivative of the parent compound) and MC3 (a propionic acid derivative). MC5 has a longer elimination half-life of approximately 7.6 hours, and takes about a week to reach steady-state concentration under daily-dosing. MC5 is a mu-opioid agonist but not delta-opioid agonist, with EC50 at the mu-opioid receptor of 0.545 μM (vs 0.194 μM for tianeptine). MC3 is a very weak mu-opioid agonist, with an EC50 of 16 μM. Tianeptine is excreted 65% in the urine and 15% in feces. </p> <p>In terms of chemical structure, it is similar to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), but it has significantly different pharmacology and important structural differences, so it is not usually grouped with them. </p> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Tianeptine-analogue-8u_structure.png\"><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Tianeptine-analogue-8u_structure.png/250px-Tianeptine-analogue-8u_structure.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"160\" height=\"190\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Tianeptine-analogue-8u_structure.png/330px-Tianeptine-analogue-8u_structure.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"731\" data-file-height=\"868\"></a><figcaption>Tianeptine analogue 8u, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/126712998\">PMID 126712998</a></figcaption></figure> <p>Although several related compounds are disclosed in the original patent, no activity data are provided and it was unclear whether these share tianeptine's unique pharmacological effects. More recent structure-activity relationship studies have since been conducted, providing some further insight on μ-opioid, δ-opioid, and pharmacokinetic activity. Derivatives where the aromatic chlorine substituent is replaced by bromine, iodine or methylthio, and/or the heptanoic acid tail is varied in length or replaced with other groups such as 3-methoxypropyl, show similar or increased opioid receptor activity relative to tianeptine, with up to 13x higher potency than tianeptine itself. Amineptine, the most closely related drug to have been widely studied, is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor with no significant effect on serotonin levels, nor opioid agonist activity. <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Tianeptinaline&action=edit&redlink=1\" title=\"Tianeptinaline (page does not exist)\">Tianeptinaline</a>, analog of tianeptine, is a notable class I HDAC inhbitor. </p> <p>Tianeptine was introduced for medical use in France under the brand name Stablon in 1983. </p> <div><h2 >Society and culture</h2><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Tianeptine&action=edit&section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Society and culture\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:StablonBox.jpg\"><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/de/StablonBox.jpg/250px-StablonBox.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"250\" height=\"193\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/de/StablonBox.jpg/500px-StablonBox.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"900\" data-file-height=\"696\"></a><figcaption>Stablon box and blister pack.</figcaption></figure> <div><h3 >Approval and brand names</h3><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Tianeptine&action=edit&section=18\" title=\"Edit section: Approval and brand names\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Brand names include: </p> <ul><li>Coaxil <small>(BG, CR, CZ, EE, HU, LT, LV, PL, RO, RU, SK UA)</small></li> <li>Salymbra <small>(EE)</small></li> <li>Stablon <small>(AR, AT, BR, FR, HK, IN, ID, MY, MX, PK, PT, SG, SK, TH, TT, TR, VE)</small></li> <li>Tatinol <small>(CN)</small></li> <li>Tianeurax <small>(DE)</small></li> <li>Tynept <small>(IN)</small></li> <li>Zinosal <small>(ES)</small></li> <li>Tianesal <small>(PL)</small></li></ul> <p>Under the code names JNJ-39823277 and TPI-1062, tianeptine was previously under development for the treatment of major depressive disorder in the United States and Belgium. Phase I clinical trials were completed in Belgium and the United States in May and June 2009, respectively. For unclear reasons development of tianeptine was discontinued in both countries in January 2012. In October 2023, Tonix Pharmaceuticals announced that it had discontinued its development of tianeptine as a monotherapy for major depressive disorder after disappointing phase-2 clinical trial results. An ongoing clinical trial, sponsored by the New York Psychiatric Institute, is examining tianeptine's use in treatment-resistant depression. </p><p>U.S. National Poison Data System data on tianeptine showed a nationwide increase in tianeptine exposure calls and calls related to abuse and misuse during 2014–2017. </p> <p>As a μ-opioid agonist, tianeptine in large doses has high abuse potential. In 2001, Singapore's Ministry of Health restricted tianeptine prescribing to psychiatrists due to its recreational potential. </p><p>Between 1989 and 2004, in France 141 cases of recreational use were identified, correlating to an incidence of 1 to 3 cases per 1000 persons treated with tianeptine and 45 between 2006 and 2011. According to Servier, stopping of treatment with tianeptine is difficult, due to the possibility of withdrawal symptoms. The severity of the withdrawal is dependent on the daily dose, with high doses being extremely difficult to quit. An official DEA statement states that the withdrawal symptoms in humans typically result in: agitation, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, hypertension, diarrhea, tremor, and diaphoresis, similar to other opioid drugs. </p><p>In 2007, according to French Health Products Safety Agency, tianeptine's manufacturer Servier agreed to modify the drug's label, following problems with dependency. </p><p>Tianeptine has been intravenously injected by drug users in Russia. This method of administration reportedly causes an opioid-like effect and is sometimes used in an attempt to lessen opioid withdrawal symptoms. Tianeptine tablets contain silica and do not dissolve completely. Often the solution is not filtered well thus particles in the injected fluid block capillaries, leading to thrombosis and then severe necrosis. Thus, in Russia tianeptine (sold under the brand name \"Coaxil\") is a schedule III controlled substance in the same list as the majority of benzodiazepines and barbiturates. </p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has expressed concern that tianeptine may be an \"emerging public health risk\", citing an increase in exposure-related calls to poison control centers in the United States. Sold retail as a dietary supplement and touted as a mood-booster and an aid for concentration, it is colloquially known as \"gas-station heroin\". In the US, it is an unregulated drug sold under several product names and has been found to be adulterated with synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs) or other drugs. </p><p>A literature review conducted in 2018 found 25 articles involving 65 patients with tianeptine abuse or dependence. Limited data showed that a majority of patients were male and that age ranged from 19 to 67. Routes of intake included oral, intravenous, and insufflation entry. In the 15 cases of overdose, 8 combined ingestion with at least one other substance, of which 3 resulted in death. Six additional deaths are reported involving tianeptine (making 9 in total). In this report, the amount of tianeptine used ranged from 50&#160;mg/day to 10&#160;g/day orally. </p> <p>In 2003, Bahrain classified tianeptine a controlled substance due to increasing reports of misuse and recreational use. </p><p>In Russia, tianeptine (sold under the brand name \"Coaxil\") is a schedule III controlled substance in the same list as the majority of benzodiazepines and barbiturates. </p><p>On 13 March 2020, with a decree approved by the Minister of Health, Italy became the first European country to outlaw tianeptine considering it a Class I controlled substance. </p> <p>In the US, tianeptine is not considered by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a controlled substance or analogue thereof. However, its use in dietary supplements and food is unlawful. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings, as recently as January 2024, about the dangers of recreational tianeptine use and the risks posed by adulterated dietary supplements containing undeclared tianeptine. </p><p>On 6 April 2018, Michigan became the first US state to outlaw tianeptine sodium, classifying it as a schedule II controlled substance. The scheduling of tianeptine sodium is effective 4 July 2018. </p><p>On 1 November 2019, Tianeptine became a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance as classified within the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Act of the state of Oklahoma. </p><p>On 15 March 2021, Alabama outlawed tianeptine, initially classifying it as a schedule II controlled substance. It was later reclassified as a schedule I controlled substance on 14 November 2021. </p><p>On 1 July 2022, Tennessee outlawed tianeptine and adds \"any salt, sulfate, free acid, or other preparation of tianeptine, and any salt, sulfate, free acid, compound, derivative, precursor, or preparation thereof that is substantially chemically equivalent or identical with tianeptine\", classifying it as a schedule II controlled substance. </p><p>On 22 December 2022, Ohio outlawed tianeptine, classifying it as a schedule I controlled substance with Ohio Governor Mike DeWine referencing the widespread availability of the chemical there as \"gas-station heroin\". </p><p>On 23 March 2023, Kentucky outlawed tianeptine, classifying it as a schedule I substance by an order of the Governor of Kentucky. On 20 September 2023, Florida outlawed tianeptine, classifying it as a schedule I substance by an administrative edict issued by the Florida Attorney General. </p> <ul><li>Amineptine</li> <li>Gas station weed</li> <li>List of antidepressants</li> <li>List of investigational anxiolytics</li> <li>Tianeptine/naloxone</li></ul> <div> <ol> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b> <cite >Uzbekov M (2011). <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-psychiatry/article/abs/fc1309-antidepressant-tianeptine-tia-action-is-based-on-the-acceleration-of-serotonin-turnover-in-the-synapse-a-hypothesis/556C8D1EDAC950D0FBB8CED6B5651B9A\">\"FC13-09 - Antidepressant tianeptine (TIA) action is based on the acceleration of serotonin turnover in the synapse: a hypothesis\"</a>. <i>European Psychiatry</i>. <b>26</b>: 1890. doi:<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016%2FS0924-9338%2811%2973594-5\">10.1016/S0924-9338(11)73594-5</a>.

sold under the brand names **Stablon**, **Tatinol**, and **Coaxil** among others, is an [atypical](/wiki/Atypical_antidepressant) [tricyclic antidepressant](/wiki/Tricyclic_antidepressant) which is used mainly in the treatment of [major depressive disorder](/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder), although it may also be used to treat [anxiety](/wiki/Anxiety), [asthma](/wiki/Asthma), and [irritable bowel syndrome](/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome).[[3]](#cite_note-Elks2014-3)[[4]](#cite_note-IndexNominum2000-4)[[5]](#cite_note-Drugs.com-5)\nTianeptine has antidepressant and [anxiolytic](/wiki/Anxiolytic) effects[[13]](#cite_note-pmid2902922-13) with a relative lack of [sedative](/wiki/Sedation), [anticholinergic](/wiki/Anticholinergic), and [cardiovascular](/wiki/Cardiovascular) [side effects](/wiki/Side_effect).[[10]](#cite_note-Tian2001-10)[[14]](#cite_note-CNS2008-14) It has been found to act as an atypical [agonist](/wiki/Agonist) of the [μ-opioid receptor](/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid_receptor) with clinically negligible effects on the [δ-](/wiki/%CE%94-opioid_receptor) and [κ-opioid receptors](/wiki/%CE%9A-opioid_receptor).[[15]](#cite_note-pmid25026323-15)[[16]](#cite_note-16)[[17]](#cite_note-pmid30070980-17) This may explain part of its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects; however, it is thought that tianeptine also modulates [glutamate receptors](/wiki/Glutamate_receptor), and this may also explain tianeptine's antidepressant/anxiolytic effects.\nTianeptine was discovered and patented by the French Society of Medical Research in the 1960s. It was introduced for medical use in [France](/wiki/France) in 1983.[[18]](#cite_note-PharmManuEnc2013-18) Currently, tianeptine is approved in France and manufactured and marketed by Laboratories [Servier](/wiki/Servier) SA; it is also marketed in a number of other European countries under the trade name Coaxil as well as in Asia (including [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore)) and Latin America as Stablon and Tatinol but it is not available in [Australia](/wiki/Australia), [Canada](/wiki/Canada), [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand), [Italy](/wiki/Italy) or the [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom).[[19]](#cite_note-akiki-19)[[20]](#cite_note-MD-20) In the US, it is an unregulated drug sold under several names and some of these products have been found to be adulterated with other [recreational drugs](/wiki/Recreational_drugs). It is commonly known by the nickname \"gas station heroin\".[[21]](#cite_note-:0-21)[[22]](#cite_note-mmwr-22)\n\n### Depression and anxiety\n\nTianeptine shows efficacy against serious depressive episodes ([major depression](/wiki/Major_depression)), comparable to [amitriptyline](/wiki/Amitriptyline), [imipramine](/wiki/Imipramine) and [fluoxetine](/wiki/Fluoxetine), but with significantly fewer side effects.[[19]](#cite_note-akiki-19) It was shown to be more effective than [maprotiline](/wiki/Maprotiline) in a group of people with co-existing depression and anxiety.[[10]](#cite_note-Tian2001-10) Tianeptine also displays significant [anxiolytic](/wiki/Anxiolytic) properties and is useful in treating a spectrum of anxiety disorders including [panic disorder](/wiki/Panic_disorder), as evidenced by a study in which those administered 35% [CO2](/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) gas ([carbogen](/wiki/Carbogen)) on [paroxetine](/wiki/Paroxetine) or tianeptine therapy showed equivalent panic-blocking effects.[[23]](#cite_note-Schruers_and_Griez_2004-23) Like many antidepressants (including [bupropion](/wiki/Bupropion), the [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors](/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitors), the [serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors](/wiki/Serotonin-norepinephrine_reuptake_inhibitors), [moclobemide](/wiki/Moclobemide) and numerous others) it may also have a beneficial effect on cognition in people with [depression-induced cognitive dysfunction](/wiki/Pseudodementia).[[24]](#cite_note-24) A 2005 study in Egypt showed tianeptine to be effective in men with depression and [erectile dysfunction](/wiki/Erectile_dysfunction).[[25]](#cite_note-erectile_dysfunction-25)\nTianeptine has been found to be effective in depression, in people with [Parkinson's disease](/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease),[[26]](#cite_note-26) and with [post-traumatic stress disorder](/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder)[[27]](#cite_note-27) for which it was as safe and effective as fluoxetine and moclobemide.[[28]](#cite_note-28)\n\nA clinical trial comparing its efficacy and tolerability with amitriptyline in the treatment of [irritable bowel syndrome](/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome) showed that tianeptine was at least as effective as amitriptyline and produced fewer prominent adverse effects, such as dry mouth and constipation.[[29]](#cite_note-29)\nTianeptine has been reported to be very effective for [asthma](/wiki/Asthma). In August 1998, Dr. Fuad Lechin and colleagues at the [Central University of Venezuela](/wiki/Central_University_of_Venezuela) Institute of Experimental Medicine in [Caracas](/wiki/Caracas) published the results of a 52-week [randomized controlled trial](/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial) of asthmatic children; the children in the groups who received tianeptine had a sharp decrease in clinical rating and increased lung function.[[30]](#cite_note-By_2004-30) Two years earlier, they had found a close, positive association between free serotonin in [plasma](/wiki/Blood_plasma) and severity of asthma in symptomatic persons.[[30]](#cite_note-By_2004-30) As tianeptine was the only agent known to both reduce free serotonin in plasma and enhance uptake in platelets, they decided to use it to see if reducing free serotonin levels in plasma would help.[[30]](#cite_note-By_2004-30) By November 2004, there had been two double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trials and an under-25,000 person open-label study lasting over seven years, both showing effectiveness.[[30]](#cite_note-By_2004-30)\nTianeptine also has [anticonvulsant](/wiki/Anticonvulsant) and [analgesic](/wiki/Analgesic) effects,[[31]](#cite_note-pmid17826881-31) and a clinical trial in Spain that ended in January 2007 has shown that tianeptine is effective in treating pain due to [fibromyalgia](/wiki/Fibromyalgia).[[32]](#cite_note-32) Tianeptine has been shown to have efficacy with minimal side effects in the treatment of [attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder](/wiki/Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder).[[33]](#cite_note-pmid15034228-33)\n\nKnown contraindications include the following:[[34]](#cite_note-34)\n\n- Hypersensitivity to tianeptine or any of the tablet's [excipients](/wiki/Excipient).[[35]](#cite_note-35)\n\nCompared to other [tricyclic antidepressants](/wiki/Tricyclic_antidepressant), it produces significantly fewer cardiovascular, [anticholinergic](/wiki/Anticholinergic) (like dry mouth or constipation), [sedative](/wiki/Sedative) and appetite-stimulating effects.[[14]](#cite_note-CNS2008-14)[[19]](#cite_note-akiki-19) Unlike other tricyclic antidepressants, tianeptine does not affect heart function.[[36]](#cite_note-36)\nμ-Opioid receptor agonists can sometimes induce [euphoria](/wiki/Euphoria), as does tianeptine, occasionally, at high doses, well above the normal therapeutic range (see [§&#160;Recreational use](#Recreational_use) below). Tianeptine can also cause severe withdrawal symptoms after prolonged use at high doses which should prompt extreme caution.[[37]](#cite_note-auto1-37)[[38]](#cite_note-38)\n\n*Sources:*[[10]](#cite_note-Tian2001-10)[[14]](#cite_note-CNS2008-14)[[39]](#cite_note-39)\n\nCommon (>1% frequency)\n\n- Headache (up to

It may also facilitate signal transduction at the CA3 commissural associational synapse by altering the phosphorylation state of glutamate receptors. With the discovery of the rapid and novel antidepressant effects of drugs such as [ketamine](/wiki/Ketamine), many believe the efficacy of antidepressants is related to promotion of [synaptic plasticity](/wiki/Synaptic_plasticity). This may be achieved by regulating the excitatory amino acid systems that are responsible for changes in the strength of synaptic connections as well as enhancing [BDNF](/wiki/BDNF) expression, although these findings are based largely on [preclinical](/wiki/Preclinical) studies.[[19]](#cite_note-akiki-19)\n\n#### Serotonin reuptake enhancer\n\nTianeptine is no longer labelled a selective serotonin reuptake enhancer (SSRE) antidepressant.[[47]](#cite_note-mp09-47)[[48]](#cite_note-pmid15550348-48)[[49]](#cite_note-pmid15753957-49)[[50]](#cite_note-pmid18221189-50)[[14]](#cite_note-CNS2008-14)[[19]](#cite_note-akiki-19)\nTianeptine had been found to bind to the same [allosteric site](/wiki/Allosteric_site) on the [serotonin transporter](/wiki/Serotonin_transporter) (SERT) as conventional TCAs.[[51]](#cite_note-BaileyAlmatroudi2018-51) However, whereas conventional TCAs [inhibit](/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) [serotonin](/wiki/Serotonin) [reuptake](/wiki/Reuptake) by the SERT, tianeptine appeared to enhance it.[[51]](#cite_note-BaileyAlmatroudi2018-51) This seems to be because of the unique C3 [amino](/wiki/Amine) [heptanoic acid](/wiki/Heptanoic_acid) [side chain](/wiki/Side_chain) of tianeptine, which, in contrast to other TCAs, is thought to lock the SERT in a [conformation](/wiki/Protein_conformation) that increases [affinity](/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)) for and reuptake ([Vmax](/wiki/Michaelis%E2%80%93Menten_kinetics)) of serotonin.[[51]](#cite_note-BaileyAlmatroudi2018-51) As such, tianeptine was thought to act a [positive allosteric modulator](/wiki/Positive_allosteric_modulator) of the SERT, or as a \"[serotonin reuptake enhancer](/wiki/Serotonin_reuptake_enhancer)\".[[51]](#cite_note-BaileyAlmatroudi2018-51)\nAlthough tianeptine was originally found to have no effect *in vitro* on monoamine reuptake, release, or receptor binding, upon acute and repeated administration, tianeptine decreased the extracellular levels of serotonin in rat brain without a decrease in serotonin release, leading to a theory of tianeptine enhancing serotonin reuptake.[[52]](#cite_note-pmid3437921-52) The (−)-[enantiomer](/wiki/Enantiomer) is more active in this sense than the (+)-enantiomer.[[53]](#cite_note-53) However, more recent studies found that long-term administration of tianeptine does not elicit any marked alterations (neither increases nor decreases) in extracellular levels of serotonin in rats.[[47]](#cite_note-mp09-47) However, coadministration of tianeptine and the [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor](/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor) [fluoxetine](/wiki/Fluoxetine) inhibited the effect of tianeptine on [long-term potentiation](/wiki/Long-term_potentiation) in [hippocampal CA1 area](/wiki/Hippocampus_anatomy). This is considered an argument for the opposite effects of tianeptine and fluoxetine on serotonin uptake,[[14]](#cite_note-CNS2008-14) although it has been shown that fluoxetine can be partially substituted for tianeptine in animal studies.[[54]](#cite_note-pmid16292591-54) In any case, the collective research suggests that direct modulation of the serotonin system is unlikely to be the [mechanism of action](/wiki/Mechanism_of_action) underlying the antidepressant effects of tianeptine.[[51]](#cite_note-BaileyAlmatroudi2018-51)\n\nTianeptine modestly enhances the [mesolimbic](/wiki/Mesolimbic) release of [dopamine](/wiki/Dopamine)[[55]](#cite_note-55) and potentiates [CNS](/wiki/Central_nervous_system) [D2](/wiki/Dopamine_D2_receptor) and [D3 receptors](/wiki/Dopamine_D3_receptor).[[56]](#cite_note-pmid11981225-56) Tianeptine has no affinity for the [dopamine transporter](/wiki/Dopamine_transporter) or the [dopamine receptors](/wiki/Dopamine_receptor).[[47]](#cite_note-mp09-47) [CREB](/wiki/CREB)-TF (CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein)[[57]](#cite_note-ReferenceA-57) is a cellular [transcription factor](/wiki/Transcription_factor).

          "abstract": "A systematic review and random-effects model network meta-analysis were conducted to compare the efficacy, acceptability, tolerability, and safety of antidepressants to treat adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) in the maintenance phase. This study searched the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases and included only double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials with an enrichment design: patients were stabilized on the antidepressant of interest during the open-label study and then randomized to receive the same antidepressant or placebo. The outcomes were the 6-month relapse rate (primary outcome, efficacy), all-cause discontinuation (acceptability), discontinuation due to adverse events (tolerability), and the incidence of individual adverse events. The risk ratio with a 95% credible interval was calculated. The meta-analysis comprised 34 studies (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;9384, mean age&#x2009;=&#x2009;43.80 years, and %females&#x2009;=&#x2009;68.10%) on 20 antidepressants (agomelatine, amitriptyline, bupropion, citalopram, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, levomilnacipran, milnacipran, mirtazapine, nefazodone, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, tianeptine, venlafaxine, vilazodone, and vortioxetine) and a placebo. In terms of the 6-month relapse rate, amitriptyline, citalopram, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, mirtazapine, nefazodone, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, tianeptine, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine outperformed placebo. Compared to placebo, desvenlafaxine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine had lower all-cause discontinuation; however, sertraline had a higher discontinuation rate due to adverse events. Compared to placebo, venlafaxine was associated with a lower incidence of dizziness, while desvenlafaxine, sertraline, and vortioxetine were associated with a higher incidence of nausea/vomiting. In conclusion, desvenlafaxine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine had reasonable efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability in the treatment of adults with stable MDD.",

          "title": "Antidepressants in Children and Adolescents: Meta-Review of Efficacy, Tolerability and Suicidality in Acute Treatment.",
          "abstract": "Antidepressants are prescribed for the treatment of a number of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents, however there is still controversy about whether they should be used in this population. This meta-review aimed to assess the effects of antidepressants for the acute treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders (ADs), autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), enuresis, major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children and adolescents. Efficacy was measured as response to treatment (either as mean overall change in symptoms or as a dichotomous outcome) and tolerability was measured as the proportion of patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse events. Suicidality was measured as suicidal ideation, behavior (including suicide attempts) and completed suicide. PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were systematically searched (until 31 October 2019) for existing systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses of double-blind randomized controlled trials. The quality of the included reviews was appraised using AMSTAR-2. Our meta-review included nine systematic reviews/meta-analyses (2 on ADHD; 1 on AD; 2 on ASD; 1 on enuresis; 1 on MDD, 1 on OCD and 1 on PTSD). In terms of efficacy this review found that, compared to placebo: fluoxetine was more efficacious in the treatment of MDD, fluvoxamine and paroxetine were better in the treatment of AD; fluoxetine and sertraline were more efficacious in the treatment of OCD; bupropion and desipramine improved clinician and teacher-rated ADHD symptoms; clomipramine and tianeptine were superior on some of the core symptoms of ASD; and no antidepressant was more efficacious for PTSD and enuresis. With regard to tolerability: imipramine, venlafaxine, and duloxetine were less well tolerated in MDD; no differences were found for any of the antidepressants in the treatment of anxiety disorders (ADs), ADHD, and PTSD; tianeptine and citalopram, but not clomipramine, were less well tolerated in children and adolescents with ASD. For suicidal behavior/ideation, venlafaxine (in MDD) and paroxetine (in AD) were associated with a significantly increased risk; by contrast, sertraline (in AD) was associated with a reduced risk. The majority of included systematic reviews/meta-analyses were rated as being of high or moderate in quality by the AMSTAR-2 critical appraisal tool (one and five, respectively). One included study was of low quality and two were of critically low quality. Compared to placebo, selected antidepressants can be efficacious in the acute treatment of some common psychiatric disorders, although statistically significant differences do not always translate into clinically significant results. Little information was available about tolerability of antidepressants in RCTs of OCD and in the treatment of ADHD, ASD, MDD, and PTSD. There is a paucity of data on suicidal ideation/behavior, but paroxetine may increase the risk of suicidality in the treatment of AD and venlafaxine for MDD. Findings from this review must be considered in light of potential limitations, such as the lack of comparative information about many antidepressants, the short-term outcomes and the quality of the available evidence.",

It was also used off-label by individuals who wished to avoid fatigue, such as night workers or others who needed to stay awake and alert for long periods of time. Additionally, the medication has been used non-medically as a novel vigilance-promoting agent. </p><p>Adrafinil is a prodrug; it is primarily metabolized <i>in vivo</i> to modafinil, resulting in very similar pharmacological effects. Unlike modafinil, however, it takes time for the metabolite to accumulate to active levels in the bloodstream. Effects usually are apparent within 45–60 minutes when taken orally on an empty stomach. </p><p>Adrafinil was marketed in France until September 2011 when it was voluntarily discontinued due to an unfavorable risk–benefit ratio. </p> <p>Adrafinil is a wakefulness-promoting agent and was used to promote alertness, attention, wakefulness, and mood. It was particularly used in the elderly. </p> <p>Adrafinil was available in the form of 300&#160;mg oral tablets. </p> <p>There is a case report of two patients that adrafinil may increase interest in sex. </p><p>A case report of adrafinil-induced orofacial dyskinesia exists. Reports of this side effect also exist for modafinil. </p> <p>Because <a href=\"/wiki/Alpha-1_adrenergic_receptor\" title=\"Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor\">α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor</a> antagonists were found to block effects of adrafinil and modafinil in animals, \"most investigators assume[d] that adrafinil and modafinil both serve as α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonists.\" However, adrafinil and modafinil have not been found to bind to the α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor and they lack peripheral sympathomimetic side effects associated with activation of this receptor; hence, the evidence in support of this hypothesis is weak, and other mechanisms are probable. Modafinil was subsequently screened at a variety of targets in 2009 and was found to act as a weak, atypical blocker of the dopamine transporter (and hence as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor), and this action may explain some or all of its pharmacological effects. Relative to adrafinil, modafinil possesses greater specificity in its action, lacking or having a reduced incidence of many of the common side effects of the former (including stomach pain, skin irritation, anxiety, and elevated liver enzymes with prolonged use). </p> <p>In addition to modafinil, adrafinil also produces modafinil acid (CRL-40467) and modafinil sulfone (CRL-41056) as metabolites, which form from metabolic modification of modafinil. </p> <p>Adrafinil is the <i>N</i>-hydroxylated analogue of modafinil and is also known as <i>N</i>-hydroxymodafinil. </p><p>Analogues of adrafinil include modafinil, armodafinil, CRL-40,940, CRL-40,941, and fluorenol, among others. </p> <p>Adrafinil was discovered in 1974 by two chemists working for the French pharmaceutical company Laboratoires Lafon who were screening compounds in search of analgesics. Pharmacological studies of adrafinil instead revealed psychostimulant-like effects such as hyperactivity and wakefulness in animals. The substance was first tested in humans, specifically for the treatment of narcolepsy, in 1977–1978. Introduced by Lafon (now Cephalon), it reached the market in France in 1984, and for the treatment of narcolepsy in 1985. </p><p>In 1976, two years after the discovery of adrafinil, its active metabolite modafinil was discovered. Modafinil appeared to be more potent than adrafinil in animal studies, and was selected for further clinical development, with both adrafinil and modafinil eventually reaching the market. Modafinil was first approved in France in 1994, and then in the United States in 1998. Lafon was acquired by Cephalon in 2001. As of September 2011, Cephalon has discontinued Olmifon, its adrafinil product, while modafinil continues to be marketed. </p> <div><h2 >Society and culture</h2><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Adrafinil&action=edit&section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Society and culture\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p><i>Adrafinil</i> is the generic name of the drug and its <a href=\"/wiki/International_Nonproprietary_Name\" title=\"International Nonproprietary Name\"><abbr title=\"International Nonproprietary Name\">INN</abbr></a>Tooltip International Nonproprietary Name and <a href=\"/wiki/D%C3%A9nomination_Commune_Fran%C3%A7aise\" title=\"Dénomination Commune Française\"><abbr title=\"Dénomination Commune Française\">DCF</abbr></a>Tooltip Dénomination Commune Française.

One company had attempted to get a New Dietary Ingredient pre-market notification approved for adrafinil in 2017, but the Food and Drug Administration rejected it: </p> <blockquote><p>“For the reasons discussed above, the information in [this pre-market] notification is incomplete and does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that ‘Adrafinil’...will reasonably be expected to be safe. Therefore, [such] product may be adulterated under 21 U.S.C. § 342(f)(1)(B)...Introduction of such a product into interstate commerce is prohibited under 21U.S.C.§331(a) and (v)”.</p></blockquote> <p>A position that adrafinil is an unapproved drug was indicated in a warning letter by the FDA in 2019: </p> <blockquote><p>“Your [particular] products [subject to this warning] [including] Adrafinil…are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are 'new drugs' under section 201(p) of the Act. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA...”</p></blockquote> <p>A position that adrafinil is an unapproved drug was also indicated by FDA in a press release regarding a criminal action undertaken in 2019: </p> <blockquote><p>“[Defendant in the 2019 enforcement action] falsely represented these drugs as legal to sell in the United States. In fact, these are drugs that were illegally imported into the United States and illegal to sell in the United States because they are not approved for sale by the Food and Drug Administration... Some of the illegal drugs [defendant] was selling include the following...Adrafinil...”</p></blockquote> <p>FDA indicated a position that adrafinil is an unapproved drug in later criminal action undertaken during 2022: “[The defendants in a 2022 enforcement action] also illegally sold multiple other unapproved and misbranded drugs, including adrafinil crystalline powder...” Most recently in 2023, the FDA fined an Arizona company 2.4 million U.S. dollars for introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce: </p> <blockquote><p>Between April 2017 and December 2021, [defendant company in 2023 enforcement action] and [its executive] marketed pharmaceutical drugs, including tianeptine, adrafinil, phenibut, and racetams, on [its website] and online platforms...They sold the drugs to customers across the United States. [Company] employees and [the company's executive] also regularly made representations about the company’s drugs through a [online] forum dedicated to [defendant company's products] products. As part of the plea, [the defendant] has agreed to forfeit $2.4 million. [The defendant] has also agreed to forfeit all tianeptine, adrafinil, phenibut, and racetams seized by the FDA and Customs and Border Protection. FDA has not approved drugs containing tianeptine, adrafinil, phenibut, and racetams for use in the United States. Racetam drugs include piracetam, aniracetam, and coluracetam, and phenylpiracetam.\"</p></blockquote> <p>Certain products, formulated with adrafinil in them, have been listed as subject to a May 2023 import alert by Food and Drug Administration because they are considered as containing an active pharmaceutical ingredient. </p><p>Adrafinil containing products, purporting to be dietary supplements, are not allowed for use by military service members. This is because the Department of Defense considers adrafinil an unapproved drug. </p> <p>In 2005 a Medical Classification Committee in New Zealand recommended to MEDSAFE NZ that adrafinil be classified as a prescription medicine due to risks of it being used as a party drug. At that time adrafinil was not scheduled in New Zealand. </p> <p>In a clinical trial with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine and placebo as comparators, adrafinil showed efficacy in the treatment of depression. In contrast to clomipramine however, adrafinil was well-tolerated, and showed greater improvement in psychomotor retardation in comparison. The authors concluded that further investigation of the potential antidepressant effects of adrafinil were warranted. </p> <div><ol> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-CFSAN_1-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-CFSAN_1-1\"></a> <cite><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/peak-nootropics-llc-aka-advanced-nootropics-557887-02052019\">\"Peak Nootropics LLC aka Advanced Nootropics - 557887 - 02/05/2019\"</a>. <i>Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN)</i>.

Additionally, the medication has been used non-medically as a novel vigilance-promoting agent.[[6]](#cite_note-Milgram2014-6)\nAdrafinil is a [prodrug](/wiki/Prodrug); it is primarily [metabolized](/wiki/Metabolize) *[in vivo](/wiki/In_vivo)* to [modafinil](/wiki/Modafinil), resulting in very similar [pharmacological](/wiki/Pharmacology) effects.[[6]](#cite_note-Milgram2014-6) Unlike modafinil, however, it takes time for the [metabolite](/wiki/Metabolite) to accumulate to active levels in the bloodstream. Effects usually are apparent within 45–60 minutes when taken orally on an empty [stomach](/wiki/Stomach).[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]\nAdrafinil was marketed in France until September 2011 when it was voluntarily discontinued due to an unfavorable [risk–benefit ratio](/wiki/Risk%E2%80%93benefit_ratio).[[7]](#cite_note-ANSM2011-7)\n\nAdrafinil is a [wakefulness-promoting agent](/wiki/Wakefulness-promoting_agent) and was used to promote alertness, attention, wakefulness, and mood.[[6]](#cite_note-Milgram2014-6) It was particularly used in the elderly.[[6]](#cite_note-Milgram2014-6)\n\nAdrafinil was available in the form of 300&#160;mg [oral](/wiki/Oral_administration) [tablets](/wiki/Tablet_(pharmacy)).[[9]](#cite_note-KleemannEngelKutscher2014-9)[[7]](#cite_note-ANSM2011-7)\n\nThere is a [case report](/wiki/Case_report) of two patients that adrafinil may increase interest in sex.[[6]](#cite_note-Milgram2014-6)\nA [case report](/wiki/Case_report) of adrafinil-induced [orofacial dyskinesia](/wiki/Orofacial_dyskinesia) exists.[[10]](#cite_note-Aronson2012-10)[[11]](#cite_note-pmid15300665-11) Reports of this side effect also exist for modafinil.[[10]](#cite_note-Aronson2012-10)\n\nBecause [α1-adrenergic receptor](/wiki/Alpha-1_adrenergic_receptor) [antagonists](/wiki/Receptor_antagonist) were found to block effects of adrafinil and modafinil in animals, \"most investigators assume[d] that adrafinil and modafinil both serve as α1-adrenergic receptor agonists.\"[[6]](#cite_note-Milgram2014-6) However, adrafinil and modafinil have not been found to bind to the α1-adrenergic receptor and they lack [peripheral](/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system) [sympathomimetic](/wiki/Sympathomimetic) [side effects](/wiki/Side_effect) associated with activation of this receptor;[[12]](#cite_note-pmid6310690-12) hence, the evidence in support of this hypothesis is weak, and other mechanisms are probable.[[6]](#cite_note-Milgram2014-6) Modafinil was subsequently screened at a variety of targets in 2009 and was found to act as a weak, atypical [blocker](/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) of the [dopamine transporter](/wiki/Dopamine_transporter) (and hence as a [dopamine reuptake inhibitor](/wiki/Dopamine_reuptake_inhibitor)), and this action may explain some or all of its pharmacological effects.[[13]](#cite_note-ZolkowskaJain2009-13)[[14]](#cite_note-ReithBlough2015-14)[[15]](#cite_note-QuisenberryBaker2015-15) Relative to adrafinil, modafinil possesses greater specificity in its action, lacking or having a reduced incidence of many of the common side effects of the former (including [stomach pain](/wiki/Stomach_pain), [skin irritation](/wiki/Skin_irritation), [anxiety](/wiki/Anxiety), and elevated [liver](/wiki/Liver) [enzymes](/wiki/Enzyme) with prolonged use).[[16]](#cite_note-Ballas-16)[[17]](#cite_note-SchatzbergNemeroff2009-17)\n\nIn addition to modafinil, adrafinil also produces [modafinil acid](/wiki/Modafinil_acid) (CRL-40467) and [modafinil sulfone](/wiki/Modafinil_sulfone) (CRL-41056) as metabolites, which form from metabolic modification of modafinil.\n\nAdrafinil is the *N*-[hydroxylated](/wiki/Hydroxyl_group) [analogue](/wiki/Structural_analogue) of [modafinil](/wiki/Modafinil) and is also known as *N*-hydroxymodafinil.\nAnalogues of adrafinil include [modafinil](/wiki/Modafinil), [armodafinil](/wiki/Armodafinil), [CRL-40,940](/wiki/CRL-40,940), [CRL-40,941](/wiki/CRL-40,941), and [fluorenol](/wiki/Fluorenol), among others.\n\nAdrafinil was discovered in 1974 by two chemists working for the French pharmaceutical company Laboratoires Lafon who were screening compounds in search of [analgesics](/wiki/Analgesic).[[18]](#cite_note-Guglietta2014-18) Pharmacological studies of adrafinil instead revealed [psychostimulant](/wiki/Psychostimulant)-like effects such as [hyperactivity](/wiki/Hyperactivity) and [wakefulness](/wiki/Wakefulness) in animals.[[18]](#cite_note-Guglietta2014-18) The substance was first tested in humans, specifically for the treatment of narcolepsy, in 1977–1978.[[18]](#cite_note-Guglietta2014-18) Introduced by Lafon (now Cephalon), it reached the market in France in 1984,[[7]](#cite_note-ANSM2011-7) and for the treatment of narcolepsy in 1985.[[18]](#cite_note-Guglietta2014-18)[[19]](#cite_note-LiJohnson2013-19)\nIn 1976, two years after the discovery of adrafinil, its [active metabolite](/wiki/Active_metabolite)  modafinil was discovered.[[18]](#cite_note-Guglietta2014-18) Modafinil appeared to be more potent than adrafinil in animal studies, and was selected for further clinical development, with both adrafinil and modafinil eventually reaching the market.[[18]](#cite_note-Guglietta2014-18) Modafinil was first approved in France in 1994, and then in the United States in 1998.[[19]](#cite_note-LiJohnson2013-19) Lafon was acquired by [Cephalon](/wiki/Cephalon_(company)) in 2001.[[20]](#cite_note-20) As of September 2011, Cephalon has discontinued Olmifon, its adrafinil product, while modafinil continues to be marketed.[[7]](#cite_note-ANSM2011-7)\n\n## Society and culture\n\n*Adrafinil* is the [generic name](/wiki/Generic_term) of the drug and its [INN](/wiki/International_Nonproprietary_Name)Tooltip International Nonproprietary Name and [DCF](/wiki/D%C3%A9nomination_Commune_Fran%C3%A7aise)Tooltip Dénomination Commune Française.[[8]](#cite_note-IndexNominum2000-8) It is also known by its brand name Olmifon and its developmental code name *CRL-40028*.[[8]](#cite_note-IndexNominum2000-8)\n\nAdrafinil and its [active metabolite](/wiki/Active_metabolite) modafinil were added to the list of substances prohibited for athletic competition according to [World Anti-Doping Agency](/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency) in 2004.[[21]](#cite_note-21)\n\n#### Additive in United States dietary supplements\n\nAdrafinil is sometimes included as an ingredient in misbranded or adulterated dietary supplements. One company had attempted to get a New Dietary Ingredient pre-market notification approved for adrafinil in 2017, but the [Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) rejected[[22]](#cite_note-22) it:\n\n“For the reasons discussed above, the information in [this pre-market] notification is incomplete and does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that ‘Adrafinil’...will reasonably be expected to be safe. Therefore, [such] product may be adulterated under 21 U.S.C. § 342(f)(1)(B)...Introduction of such a product into interstate commerce is prohibited under 21U.S.C.§331(a) and (v)”.\n\nA position that adrafinil is an unapproved drug was indicated in a warning letter[[1]](#cite_note-CFSAN-1) by the FDA in 2019:\n\n“Your [particular] products [subject to this warning] [including] Adrafinil…are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are 'new drugs' under section 201(p) of the Act. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA...”\n\nA position that adrafinil is an unapproved drug was also indicated by FDA in a press release regarding a criminal action[[2]](#cite_note-ORA_2019-2) undertaken in 2019:\n\n“[Defendant in the 2019 enforcement action] falsely represented these drugs as legal to sell in the United States. In fact, these are drugs that were illegally imported into the United States and illegal to sell in the United States because they are not approved for sale by the Food and Drug Administration... Some of the illegal drugs [defendant] was selling include the following...Adrafinil...”\n\nFDA indicated a position that adrafinil is an unapproved drug in later criminal action undertaken during 2022: “[The defendants in a 2022 enforcement action] also illegally sold multiple other unapproved and misbranded drugs, including adrafinil crystalline powder...”[[3]](#cite_note-OCI_2022-3) Most recently in 2023, the FDA fined[[4]](#cite_note-Arizona-4) an Arizona company 2.4 million [U.S. dollars](/wiki/U.s._dollar) for introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce:\n\nBetween April 2017 and December 2021, [defendant company in 2023 enforcement action] and [its executive] marketed pharmaceutical drugs, including tianeptine, adrafinil, phenibut, and racetams, on [its website] and online platforms...They sold the drugs to customers across the United States. [Company] employees and [the company's executive] also regularly made representations about the company’s drugs through a [online] forum dedicated to [defendant company's products] products.  As part of the plea, [the defendant] has agreed to forfeit $2.4 million. [The defendant] has also agreed to forfeit all tianeptine, adrafinil, phenibut, and racetams seized by the FDA and Customs and Border Protection.\nFDA has not approved drugs containing tianeptine, adrafinil, phenibut, and racetams for use in the United States. Racetam drugs include piracetam, aniracetam, and coluracetam, and phenylpiracetam.\"\nCertain products, formulated with adrafinil in them, have been listed as subject to a May 2023 import alert by [Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) because they are considered as containing an active pharmaceutical ingredient.[[23]](#cite_note-23)\nAdrafinil containing products, purporting to be dietary supplements, are not allowed for use by military service members. This is because the [Department of Defense](/wiki/Department_of_Defense) considers adrafinil an unapproved drug.[[24]](#cite_note-24)\n\nIn 2005 a Medical Classification Committee in [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand) recommended to MEDSAFE NZ that adrafinil be classified as a [prescription medicine](/wiki/Prescription_medicine) due to risks of it being used as a [party drug](/wiki/Party_drug).  At that time adrafinil was not scheduled in New Zealand.[[25]](#cite_note-25)\n\nIn a [clinical trial](/wiki/Clinical_trial) with the [tricyclic antidepressant](/wiki/Tricyclic_antidepressant) [clomipramine](/wiki/Clomipramine) and [placebo](/wiki/Placebo) as comparators, adrafinil showed efficacy in the treatment of [depression](/wiki/Depression_(mood)).[[6]](#cite_note-Milgram2014-6) In contrast to clomipramine however, adrafinil was well-tolerated, and showed greater improvement in [psychomotor retardation](/wiki/Psychomotor_retardation) in comparison.[[6]](#cite_note-Milgram2014-6) The authors concluded that further investigation of the potential antidepressant effects of adrafinil were warranted.[[6]](#cite_note-Milgram2014-6)\n\n^ [***a***](#cite_ref-CFSAN_1-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-CFSAN_1-1) [\"Peak Nootropics LLC aka Advanced Nootropics - 557887 - 02/05/2019\"](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/peak-nootropics-llc-aka-advanced-nootropics-557887-02052019). *Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN)*.

          "abstract": "Modafinil is a nonamphetamine nootropic drug with an increasingly therapeutic interest due to its different sites of action and behavioral effects in comparison to cocaine or amphetamine. A review of modafinil (and of its prodrug adrafinil and its R-enantiomer armodafinil) chemical, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, toxicological, clinical and forensic aspects was performed, aiming to better understand possible health problems associated to its unconscious and unruled use. Modafinil is a racemate metabolized mainly in the liver into its inactive acid and sulfone metabolites, which undergo primarily renal excretion. Although not fully clarified, major effects seem to be associated to inhibition of dopamine reuptake and modulation of several other neurochemical pathways, namely noradrenergic, serotoninergic, orexinergic, histaminergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic. Due its wake-promoting effects, modafinil is used for the treatment of daily sleepiness associated to narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea and shift work sleep disorder. Its psychotropic and cognitive effects are also attractive in several other pathologies and conditions that affect sleep structure, induce fatigue and lethargy, and impair cognitive abilities. Additionally, in health subjects, including students, modafinil is being used off-label to overcome sleepiness, increase concentration and improve cognitive potential. The most common adverse effects associated to modafinil intake are headache, insomnia, anxiety, diarrhea, dry mouth and raise in blood pressure and heart rate. Infrequently, severe dermatologic effects in children, including maculopapular and morbilliform rash, erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome have been reported. Intoxication and dependence associated to modafinil are uncommon. Further research on effects and health implications of modafinil and its analogs is steel needed to create evidence-based policies.",

It is also used in Russian cosmonauts to improve physical, mental, and cognitive abilities. The drug is taken by mouth. </p><p>Side effects of phenylpiracetam include sleep disturbances among others. The mechanism of action of phenylpiracetam was originally unknown. However, it was discovered that <a href=\"/wiki/MRZ-9547\" title=\"MRZ-9547\">(<i>R</i>)-phenylpiracetam</a> is a selective atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor in 2014. In addition, phenylpiracetam interacts with certain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Chemically, phenylpiracetam is a racetam and phenethylamine and is structurally related to piracetam. </p><p>Phenylpiracetam was first described in 1983 by Bobkov Iu, et al. It was approved for medical use in Russia in 2003. Development of (<i>R</i>)-phenylpiracetam (code name MRZ-9547) in the West as a potential treatment for fatigue related to Parkinson's disease began by 2014. </p> <meta property=\"mw:PageProp/toc\"> <p>Phenylpiracetam is used in the treatment of a variety of different medical conditions. It is specifically approved in Russia for treatment of cerebrovascular deficiency, depression, apathy, attention deficits, and memory decline. It is used to improve symptoms following encephalopathy, brain injury, and glioma surgery. The drug has been reported to improve symptoms of depression, anxiety, asthenia, and fatigue, as well as to improve cognitive performance and memory. It also has anticonvulsant effects and has been used as an add-on therapy in epilepsy. </p><p>Phenylpiracetam is typically prescribed as a general stimulant or to increase tolerance to extreme temperatures and stress. </p><p>Clinical use of phenylpiracetam has shown to be more potent than piracetam and is used for a wider-range of indications. </p><p>A few small clinical studies have shown possible links between prescription of phenylpiracetam and improvement in a number of encephalopathic conditions, including lesions of cerebral blood pathways, traumatic brain injury and certain types of glioma. </p><p>Clinical trials were conducted at the Serbsky State Scientific Center for Social and Forensic Psychiatry. The Serbsky Center, Moscow Institute of Psychiatry, and Russian Center of Vegetative Pathology are reported to have confirmed the effectiveness of phenylpiracetam describing the following effects: improvement of regional blood flow in ischemic regions of the brain, reduction of depressive and anxiety disorders, increase the resistance of brain tissue to hypoxia and toxic effects, improving concentration and mental activity, a psycho-activating effect, increase in the threshold of pain sensitivity, improvement in the quality of sleep, and an anticonvulsant action, though with the side effect of an anorexic effect in extended use. </p> <p>Phenylpiracetam is available in the form of 100&#160;mg oral tablets. </p> <p>Phenylpiracetam has a number of contraindications, such as individual intolerance. </p> <p>Side effects of phenylpiracetam include insomnia or sleep disturbances, psychomotor agitation, flushing, a feeling of warmth, and increased blood pressure, among others. </p> <p>Overdose has not been reported. </p> <p>Phenylpiracetam is a racetam and is described as a stimulant. Racetams have a variety of different pharmacological activities and have varying effects. For example, phenylpiracetam is a stimulant, piracetam is a nootropic, and levetiracetam is an anticonvulsant. The mechanisms of action of most racetams, with some exceptions, are unknown. </p><p>Phenylpiracetam is a racemic mixture. <a href=\"/wiki/MRZ-9547\" title=\"MRZ-9547\">(<i>R</i>)-Phenylpiracetam</a> is the most active enantiomer and is much more potent in stimulating locomotor activity than (<i>S</i>)-phenylpiracetam, which is ineffective. However, (<i>S</i>)-phenylpiracetam retains some activity in most pharmacological tests. On the other hand, in one animal test, the passive avoidance test, (<i>S</i>)-phenylpiracetam appeared to be antagonistic of (<i>R</i>)-phenylpiracetam. </p> <div><h4 >Dopamine reuptake inhibitor</h4><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Phenylpiracetam&action=edit&section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Dopamine reuptake inhibitor\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Experiments performed on Sprague-Dawley rats in a European patent for using phenylpiracetam to treat sleep disorders showed an increase in extracellular dopamine levels after administration. The patent asserts discovery of phenylpiracetam's action as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor as its basis. </p> <blockquote><p>The peculiarity of this invention compared to former treatment approaches for treating sleep disorders is the so far unknown therapeutic efficacy of (<i>R</i>)-phenylpiracetam, which is presumably based at least in part on the newly identified activity of (<i>R</i>)-phenylpiracetam as the dopamine re-uptake inhibitor</p></blockquote> <p>Both enantiomers of phenylpiracetam, <a href=\"/wiki/MRZ-9547\" title=\"MRZ-9547\">(<i>R</i>)-phenylpiracetam</a> and (<i>S</i>)-phenylpiracetam, have been described in peer-reviewed research as dopamine transporter (DAT) inhibitors in rodents, confirming the patent claim. Their actions at the norepinephrine transporter (NET) vary: (<i>R</i>)-phenylpiracetam acts as a dual norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), with 11-fold lower affinity for the NET than for the DAT, whereas the (<i>S</i>)-enantiomer is selective for the DAT. However, whereas (<i>R</i>)-phenylpiracetam stimulates locomotor activity, (<i>S</i>)-phenylpiracetam does not do so. This variation in effects has also been seen with other dopamine reuptake inhibitors. </p><p>Other atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitors include modafinil, mesocarb (Sydnocarb), and solriamfetol. </p> <p>Phenylpiracetam binds to <a href=\"/wiki/Alpha-4_beta-2_nicotinic_receptor\" title=\"Alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic receptor\">α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>2</sub></a> nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the mouse brain cortex with an <a href=\"/wiki/Half-maximal_inhibitory_concentration\" title=\"Half-maximal inhibitory concentration\"><abbr title=\"half-maximal inhibitory concentration\">IC<sub>50</sub></abbr></a>Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 5.86&#160;μM. </p><p>Racetams generally, but including phenylpiracetam, have been described as AMPA receptor potentiators. </p> <p>Research on animals has indicated that phenylpiracetam may have antiamnesic, antidepressant, anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant effects. Additional clinical research is necessary to determine whether these effects extend to humans. </p><p>Phenylpiracetam has been shown to reverse the sedative or depressant effects of the benzodiazepine diazepam, increases operant behavior, inhibits post-rotational nystagmus, prevents retrograde amnesia, and has anticonvulsant properties in animal models. </p><p>In Wistar rats with gravitational cerebral ischemia, phenylpiracetam reduced the extent of neuralgic deficiency manifestations, retained the locomotor, research, and memory functions, increased the survival rate, and lead to the favoring of local cerebral flow restoration upon the occlusion of carotid arteries to a greater extent than did piracetam. </p><p>In tests against a control, Sprague-Dawley rats given free access to less-preferred rat chow and trained to operate a lever repeatedly to obtain preferred rat chow performed additional work when given methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, and phenylpiracetam. Rats administered 100&#160;mg/kg phenylpiracetam performed, on average, 375% more work than rats given placebo, and consumed little non-preferred rat chow. In comparison, rats administered 1mg/kg dextroamphetamine or 10&#160;mg/kg methylphenidate performed, on average, 150% and 170% more work respectively, and consumed half as much non-preferred rat chow. </p> <blockquote><p>Present data show that (<i>R</i>)-phenylpiracetam increases motivation, i.e., the work load, which animals are willing to perform to obtain more rewarding food. At the same time consumption of freely available normal food does not increase. Generally this indicates that (<i>R</i>)-phenylpiracetam increase motivation [...] The effect of (<i>R</i>)-phenylpiracetam is much stronger than that of methylphenidate and amphetamine.</p></blockquote> <p>The pharmacokinetics of phenylpiracetam in humans are unpublished. In any case, the drug is described as having an oral bioavailability of approximately 100%, as having an onset of action of less than 1&#160;hour, as not being metabolized, as being excreted unchanged about 40% in urine and 60% in bile and sweat, and as having an elimination half-life of 3 to 5&#160;hours. In rodents, its absorption occurs within 1&#160;hour with oral administration or intramuscular injection and its elimination half-life is 2.5 to 3&#160;hours. </p> <p>Phenylpiracetam, also known as 4-phenylpiracetam, is a racetam (i.e., a 2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide derivative) and the 4-phenyl-substituted analogue of piracetam. In contrast to piracetam and most other racetams however, phenylpiracetam contains β-phenylethylamine within its chemical structure and hence can additionally be conceptualized as a substituted phenethylamine. </p><p>Phenylpiracetam is a racemic mixture of (<i>R</i>)- and (<i>S</i>)-enantiomers, <a href=\"/wiki/MRZ-9547\" title=\"MRZ-9547\">(<i>R</i>)-phenylpiracetam</a> (MRZ-9547) and (<i>S</i>)-phenylpiracetam. </p> <p>RGPU-95 (4-chlorophenylpiracetam) is a derivative of phenylpiracetam described as having 5- to 10-fold greater potency. Cebaracetam (CGS-25248; ZY-15119) is a derivative of RGPU-95 in which the terminal amide has been replaced with a 2-piperazinone moiety. </p><p>Methylphenylpiracetam, including all four of its stereoisomers (especially the (4<i>R</i>,5<i>S</i>)-enantiomer E1R), is a positive allosteric modulator of the sigma <a href=\"/wiki/Sigma-1_receptor\" title=\"Sigma-1 receptor\">σ<sub>1</sub> receptor</a>. It is currently the only known racetam demonstrating σ<sub>1</sub> receptor modulation. Whereas phenylpiracetam stimulates locomotor activity in animals, the E1R enantiomer of methylphenylpiracetam does not do so at doses of up to 200&#160;mg/kg. </p><p>Phenylpiracetam hydrazide is a hydrazide derivative of phenylpiracetam described as having anticonvulsant effects. </p><p>Other derivatives of phenylpiracetam have also been developed and studied. </p> <p>Phenylpiracetam was first described in the scientific literature by 1983. It was developed in 1983 as a medication for Soviet cosmonauts to treat the prolonged stresses of working in space. Phenylpiracetam was created at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Biomedical Problems in an effort led by psychopharmacologist Valentina Ivanovna Akhapkina (Валентина Ивановна Ахапкина). Subsequently, it became available as a prescription drug in Russia. It was approved in 2003 for treatment of various conditions. </p><p>Pilot-cosmonaut Aleksandr Serebrov described being issued and using phenylpiracetam, as well as it being included in the Soyuz spacecraft's standard emergency medical kit, during his 197-days working in space aboard the Mir space station. He reported \"the drug acts as the equalizer of the whole organism, \"tidying it up\", completely excluding impulsiveness and irritability inevitable in the stressful conditions of space flight.\" </p> <div><h2 >Society and culture</h2><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Phenylpiracetam&action=edit&section=15\" title=\"Edit section: Society and culture\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Phenotropil.jpg\"><img alt=\"Phenotropil\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Phenotropil.jpg/250px-Phenotropil.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"250\" height=\"272\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Phenotropil.jpg/500px-Phenotropil.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"800\" data-file-height=\"870\"></a><figcaption>Phenotropil 100&#160;mg from Russia.</figcaption></figure> <p>While not prescribed as a pharmaceutical in the West, in Russia and certain other Eastern European countries it is available as a prescription medicine under brand names including Phenotropil (also spelled Fenotropil, Phenotropyl, and Fenotropyl), Actitropil, and Nanotropil, among others. </p><p>Phenylpiracetam is not scheduled by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) as of 2016. </p> <p>Phenylpiracetam is manufactured by the pharmaceutical companies Valenta Pharm and Pharmstandard (Pharmstandart) in Russia. </p> <p>Phenylpiracetam has stimulant effects and may be used as a doping agent in sport. As a result, it is on the list of stimulants banned for in-competition use by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). This list is applicable in all Olympic sports. Owing to its unique stimulant properties among racetams, phenylpiracetam is the only racetam on the WADA prohibited list. </p> <p>Phenylpiracetam has been studied in the treatment of stroke and glaucoma. </p><p>The more active enantiomer of phenylpiracetam, <a href=\"/wiki/MRZ-9547\" title=\"MRZ-9547\">(<i>R</i>)-phenylpiracetam</a>, was under development for fatigue related to Parkinson's disease. However, no recent development has been reported. There was also interest in the compound for fatigue related to depression and other conditions, but this was not pursued. (<i>R</i>)-Phenylpiracetam has been identified as a selective atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRIs), and similarly to other DRIs, shows pro-motivational effects in animals and reverses motivational deficits. </p> <ul><li>Phensuximide – a succinimide analogue</li> <li>Phenibut – also included in Russian cosmonaut medical kits</li> <li>List of Russian drugs</li></ul> <div><ol> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-GromovaTorshin2024_1-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-GromovaTorshin2024_1-1\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-GromovaTorshin2024_1-2\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-GromovaTorshin2024_1-3\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-GromovaTorshin2024_1-4\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-GromovaTorshin2024_1-5\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-GromovaTorshin2024_1-6\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-GromovaTorshin2024_1-7\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-GromovaTorshin2024_1-8\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-GromovaTorshin2024_1-9\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-GromovaTorshin2024_1-10\"></a> <cite >Gromova OA, Torshin IY (2024). \"Farmakologičeskie èffekty fonturacetama (Aktitropil) i perspektivy ego kliničeskogo primenenija\" [Pharmacological effects of fonturacetam (Actitropil) and prospects for its clinical use]. <i>Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova</i> [<i>S.S.

The possible target receptors and mechanisms for the acute activity of this drug remained unclear, until very recently it was found that (R)-phenylpiracetam (5) (MRZ-9547) is a selective dopamine transporter inhibitor that moderately stimulates striatal dopamine release.19</q></cite></span> </li> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Voronina2023_5-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Voronina2023_5-1\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Voronina2023_5-2\"></a> <cite >Voronina TA (2023). <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1134%2Fs1819712423020198\">\"Cognitive Impairment and Nootropic Drugs: Mechanism of Action and Spectrum of Effects\"</a>. <i>Neurochemical Journal</i>. <b>17</b> (2).

It was experimentally established that phenylpiracetam improves learning and memory, has an antiamnesic effect, activates operant behavior, has anxiolytic, antiasthenic, and anticonvulsant effects, weakens the sedative effect of benzodiazepines, increases resistance to cold, and improves sleep [29–31]. In a model of cerebral ischemia, phenylpiracetam improves cognitive functions, reduces manifestations of neurological deficit, and is superior in effectiveness to piracetam [32, 33]. It has been shown that phenylpiracetam does not bind to GABA-A, GABA-B and dopamine receptors, or 5-HT2 serotonin receptor, but is a synaptic transmission modulator and binds to α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the cerebral cortex (IC50 = 5.86 μm) [34, 35].</q></cite></span> </li> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-SommerDanyszRuss2014_6-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-SommerDanyszRuss2014_6-1\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-SommerDanyszRuss2014_6-2\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-SommerDanyszRuss2014_6-3\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-SommerDanyszRuss2014_6-4\"></a> <cite >Sommer S, Danysz W, Russ H, Valastro B, Flik G, Hauber W (December 2014). \"The dopamine reuptake inhibitor MRZ-9547 increases progressive ratio responding in rats\". <i>The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology</i>. <b>17</b> (12): 2045–2056. doi:<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017%2FS1461145714000996\">10.1017/S1461145714000996</a>.

Retrieved 26 September 2024</span>. <q>p-Chlorophenylpiracetam is a synthetic substance that is a derivative of phenylpiracetam, a nootropic drug widely used for recreational purposes. The compound, along with other analogues, was developed to obtain more powerful analogues of phenylpiracetam for the treatment of anxiety disorders. The effect of p-chlorophenylpiracetam on the human body has not been thoroughly studied. Experiments on laboratory animals have shown that the substance has the properties of an anxiolytic, antidepressant, nootropic, and in its activity, p-chlorophenylpiracetam is 5-10 times more active than phenipiracetam, therefore, the recommended doses of the substance are about 10-60 mg. Based on the few data on specialized forums, the substance begins to act 10-15 minutes after oral administration, maximum effects are achieved after 1-3 hours, the duration of action is more than 6 hours. The prevalence of the compound is currently not great due to the presence of more studied analogs on the market. Nevertheless, p-chlorophenylpiracetam has a high social danger due to its properties and the effects it has on the body. Monitoring of the spread continues.</q></cite></span> </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-TiurenkovBagmetovaShishkina2010_40-0\">^</a></b> <cite >Tiurenkov IN, Bagmetova VV, Shishkina AV, Berestovitskaia VM, Vasil'eva OS, Ostrogliadov ES (November 2010). \"[Gender differences in action Fenotropil and its structural analog--compound RGPU-95 on anxiety-depressive behavior animals]\". <i>Eksp Klin Farmakol</i> (in Russian). <b>73</b> (11): 10–14.

Phenylpiracetam was originally designed as a nootropic drug for the sustenance and improvement of the physical condition and cognition abilities of Soviet space crews.2 Later, especially during the last decade, phenylpiracetam was introduced into general clinical practice in Russia and in some Eastern European countries. The possible target receptors and mechanisms for the acute activity of this drug remained unclear, until very recently it was found that (R)-phenylpiracetam (5) (MRZ-9547) is a selective dopamine transporter inhibitor that moderately stimulates striatal dopamine release.19\n\n^ [***a***](#cite_ref-Voronina2023_5-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-Voronina2023_5-1) [***c***](#cite_ref-Voronina2023_5-2) Voronina TA (2023).

Phenylpiracetam, a phenyl analogue of piracetam (trade names: phenotropil, carphedon, and phenylpiracetam), was developed at the Institute of Biomedical Problems as a new generation psychostimulant that can increase the mental and physical performance of astronauts at various stages of space flights. It was experimentally established that phenylpiracetam improves learning and memory, has an antiamnesic effect, activates operant behavior, has anxiolytic, antiasthenic, and anticonvulsant effects, weakens the sedative effect of benzodiazepines, increases resistance to cold, and improves sleep [29–31]. In a model of cerebral ischemia, phenylpiracetam improves cognitive functions, reduces manifestations of neurological deficit, and is superior in effectiveness to piracetam [32, 33]. It has been shown that phenylpiracetam does not bind to GABA-A, GABA-B and dopamine receptors, or 5-HT2 serotonin receptor, but is a synaptic transmission modulator and binds to α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the cerebral cortex (IC50 = 5.86 μm) [34, 35].\n\n^ [***a***](#cite_ref-SommerDanyszRuss2014_6-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-SommerDanyszRuss2014_6-1) [***c***](#cite_ref-SommerDanyszRuss2014_6-2) [***d***](#cite_ref-SommerDanyszRuss2014_6-3) [***e***](#cite_ref-SommerDanyszRuss2014_6-4) Sommer S, Danysz W, Russ H, Valastro B, Flik G, Hauber W (December 2014). \"The dopamine reuptake inhibitor MRZ-9547 increases progressive ratio responding in rats\". *The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology*. **17** (12): 2045–2056.

It inhibited norepinephrine transporter (NET) with an IC50 of 182 μM (one experiment in duplicate). The potencies for the l-enantiomer MRZ-9546 were as follows: DAT binding (Ki = 34.8 ± 14.8 μM, n=3), DAT function (IC50 = 65.5 ± 8.3 μM, n=2) and NET function (IC50 = 667 μM, one experiment performed in duplicate).\n\n^ [***a***](#cite_ref-GouliaevSenning1994_7-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-GouliaevSenning1994_7-1) [***c***](#cite_ref-GouliaevSenning1994_7-2) [***d***](#cite_ref-GouliaevSenning1994_7-3) [***e***](#cite_ref-GouliaevSenning1994_7-4) Gouliaev AH, Senning A (May 1994). \"Piracetam and other structurally related nootropics\". *Brain Res Brain Res Rev*. **19** (2): 180–222.

In recent years, the potential for cognitive enhancement through pharmacological modulation of dopamine levels in the PFC has garnered significant interest. The inverted-U functional effect of dopamine in the PFC suggests both insufficient and excessive DA levels impair cognitive performance, leading to the development of several compounds aimed at modulating dopamine levels to improve cognitive function. Many of these compounds, including CE-158, CE-123, and Sy-phenylpiracetam, work by inhibiting the dopamine transporter (DAT) to promote behavioral flexibility and cognitive enhancement in the PFC [99,100,101,102].\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-ZvejnieceZvejnieceVideja2020_23-0)** Zvejniece L, Zvejniece B, Videja M, Stelfa G, Vavers E, Grinberga S, et&#160;al.

Experiments on laboratory animals have shown that the substance has the properties of an anxiolytic, antidepressant, nootropic, and in its activity, p-chlorophenylpiracetam is 5-10 times more active than phenipiracetam, therefore, the recommended doses of the substance are about 10-60 mg. Based on the few data on specialized forums, the substance begins to act 10-15 minutes after oral administration, maximum effects are achieved after 1-3 hours, the duration of action is more than 6 hours. The prevalence of the compound is currently not great due to the presence of more studied analogs on the market. Nevertheless, p-chlorophenylpiracetam has a high social danger due to its properties and the effects it has on the body. Monitoring of the spread continues.\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-TiurenkovBagmetovaShishkina2010_40-0)** Tiurenkov IN, Bagmetova VV, Shishkina AV, Berestovitskaia VM, Vasil'eva OS, Ostrogliadov ES (November 2010). \"[Gender differences in action Fenotropil and its structural analog--compound RGPU-95 on anxiety-depressive behavior animals]\". *Eksp Klin Farmakol* (in Russian). **73** (11): 10–14.

          "abstract": "The first nootropic prohibited in sport was fonturacetam (4-phenylpiracetam, carphedon) in 1998. Presented here 25&#x2009;years later is a broad-scale consideration of the history, pharmacology, prevalence, regulations, and doping potential of nootropics viewed through a lens of 50 selected dietary supplements (DS) marketed as \"cognitive enhancement,\" \"brain health,\" \"brain boosters,\" or \"nootropics,\" with a focus on unauthorized ingredients. Nootropic DS have risen to prominence over the last decade often as multicomponent formulations of bioactive ingredients presenting compelling pharmacological questions and potential public health concerns. Many popular nootropics are unauthorized food or DS ingredients according to the European Commission including huperzine A, yohimbine, and dimethylaminoethanol; unapproved pharmaceuticals like phenibut or emoxypine (mexidol); previously registered drugs like meclofenoxate or reserpine; EU authorized pharmaceuticals like piracetam or vinpocetine; infamous doping agents like methylhexaneamine or dimethylbutylamine; and other investigational substances and peptides. Several are authorized DS ingredients in the United States resulting in significant global variability as to what qualifies as a legal nootropic. Prohibited stimulants or &#xdf;2-agonists commonly used in \"pre-workout,\" \"weight loss,\" or \"thermogenic\" DS such as octodrine, hordenine, or higenamine are often stacked with nootropic substances. While stimulants and &#xdf;2-agonists are defined as doping agents by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), many nootropics are not, although some may qualify as non-approved substances or related substances under catch-all language in the WADA Prohibited List. Synergistic combinations, excessive dosing, or recently researched pharmacology may justify listing certain nootropics as doping agents or warrant additional attention in future regulations.",

          "abstract": "S-phenylpiracetam is an optical isomer of phenotropil, which is a clinically used nootropic drug that improves physical condition and cognition. Recently, it was shown that S-phenylpiracetam is a selective dopamine transporter (DAT) inhibitor that does not influence norepinephrine (NE) or serotonin (5-HT) receptors. The aim of the present study was to study the effects of S-phenylpiracetam treatment on body weight gain, blood glucose and leptin levels, and locomotor activity. Western diet (WD)-fed mice and obese Zucker rats were treated daily with peroral administration of S-phenylpiracetam for 8 and 12weeks, respectively. Weight gain and plasma metabolites reflecting glucose metabolism were measured. Locomotor activity was detected in an open-field test. S-phenylpiracetam treatment significantly decreased body weight gain and fat mass increase in the obese Zucker rats and in the WD-fed mice. In addition, S-phenylpiracetam reduced the plasma glucose and leptin concentration and lowered hyperglycemia in a glucose tolerance test in both the mice and the rats. S-phenylpiracetam did not influence locomotor activity in the obese Zucker rats or in the WD-fed mice. The results demonstrate that S-phenylpiracetam reduces body weight gain and improves adaptation to hyperglycemia without stimulating locomotor activity. Our findings suggest that selective DAT inhibitors, such as S-phenylpiracetam, could be potentially useful for treating obesity in patients with metabolic syndrome with fewer adverse health consequences compared to other anorectic agents.",

          "title": "Piracetam and piracetam-like drugs: from basic science to novel clinical applications to CNS disorders.",
          "abstract": "There is an increasing interest in nootropic drugs for the treatment of CNS disorders. Since the last meta-analysis of the clinical efficacy of piracetam, more information has accumulated. The primary objective of this systematic survey is to evaluate the clinical outcomes as well as the scientific literature relating to the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, mechanism of action, dosing, toxicology and adverse effects of marketed and investigational drugs. The major focus of the literature search was on articles demonstrating evidence-based clinical investigations during the past 10 years for the following therapeutic categories of CNS disorders: (i) cognition/memory; (ii) epilepsy and seizure; (iii) neurodegenerative diseases; (iv) stroke/ischaemia; and (v) stress and anxiety. In this article, piracetam-like compounds are divided into three subgroups based on their chemical structures, known efficacy and intended clinical uses. Subgroup 1 drugs include piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, pramiracetam and phenylpiracetam, which have been used in humans and some of which are available as dietary supplements. Of these, oxiracetam and aniracetam are no longer in clinical use. Pramiracetam reportedly improved cognitive deficits associated with traumatic brain injuries. Although piracetam exhibited no long-term benefits for the treatment of mild cognitive impairments, recent studies demonstrated its neuroprotective effect when used during coronary bypass surgery. It was also effective in the treatment of cognitive disorders of cerebrovascular and traumatic origins; however, its overall effect on lowering depression and anxiety was higher than improving memory. As add-on therapy, it appears to benefit individuals with myoclonus epilepsy and tardive dyskinesia. Phenylpiracetam is more potent than piracetam and is used for a wider range of indications. In combination with a vasodilator drug, piracetam appeared to have an additive beneficial effect on various cognitive disabilities. Subgroup 2 drugs include levetiracetam, seletracetam and brivaracetam, which demonstrate antiepileptic activity, although their cognitive effects are unclear. Subgroup 3 includes piracetam derivatives with unknown clinical efficacies, and of these nefiracetam failed to improve cognition in post-stroke patients and rolipram is currently in clinical trials as an antidepressant. The remaining compounds of this subgroup are at various preclinical stages of research. The modes of action of piracetam and most of its derivatives remain an enigma. Differential effects on subtypes of glutamate receptors, but not the GABAergic actions, have been implicated. Piracetam seems to activate calcium influx into neuronal cells; however, this function is questionable in the light of findings that a persistent calcium inflow may have deleterious impact on neuronal cells. Although subgroup 2 compounds act via binding to another neuronal receptor (synaptic vesicle 2A), some of the subgroup 3 compounds, such as nefiracetam, are similar to those of subgroup 1. Based on calculations of the efficacy rates, our assessments indicate notable improvements in clinical outcomes with some of these agents.",

<b>ostarine</b> and by the developmental code names <b>GTx-024</b>, <b>MK-2866</b>, and <b>S-22</b>, is a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) which is under development for the treatment of androgen receptor-positive breast cancer in women and for improvement of body composition (e.g., prevention of muscle loss) in people taking GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide. It was also under development for a variety of other indications, including treatment of cachexia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, muscle atrophy or sarcopenia, and stress urinary incontinence, but development for all other uses has been discontinued. Enobosarm was evaluated for the treatment of muscle wasting related to cancer in late-stage clinical trials, and the drug improved lean body mass in these trials, but it was not effective in improving muscle strength. As a result, enobosarm was not approved and development for this use was terminated. Enobosarm is taken by mouth. </p><p>Known possible side effects of enobosarm include headache, fatigue, anemia, nausea, diarrhea, back pain, adverse lipid changes like decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, changes in sex hormone concentrations like decreased testosterone levels, elevated liver enzymes, and liver toxicity, among others. The potential masculinizing effects of enobosarm, for instance in women, have largely not been evaluated and are unknown. The potential adverse effects and risks of high doses of enobosarm are also unknown. Enobosarm is a nonsteroidal SARM, acting as an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens and anabolic steroids like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). However, it shows dissociation of effect between tissues in preclinical studies, with agonistic and anabolic effects in muscle and bone, agonistic effects in breast, and partially agonistic or antagonistic effects in the prostate gland and seminal vesicles. The AR-mediated effects of enobosarm in many other androgen-sensitive tissues are unknown. </p><p>Enobosarm was first identified in 2004 and has been under clinical development since at least 2005. It is the most well-studied SARM of all of the agents that have been developed. According to GTx, its developer, a total of 25 clinical studies have been carried out on more than 1,700 people involving doses from 1 to 100&#160;mg as of 2020. However, enobosarm has not yet completed clinical development or been approved for any use. As of November 2023, it is in phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of breast cancer and is in phase 2 studies for improvement of body composition in people taking GLP-1 receptor agonists. Enobosarm was developed by GTx, Inc., and is now being developed by Veru, Inc. </p><p>Aside from its development as a potential pharmaceutical drug, enobosarm is on the World Anti-Doping Agency list of prohibited substances and is sold for physique- and performance-enhancing purposes by black-market Internet suppliers. In one survey, 2.7% of young male gym users reported using SARMs. In addition, a London wastewater analysis found that enobosarm was the most abundant \"pharmaceutical drug\" detected and was more prevalent than \"classical\" recreational drugs like MDMA and cocaine. Enobosarm is often used in these contexts at doses greatly exceeding those evaluated in clinical trials, with unknown effectiveness and safety. Many products sold online that are purported to be enobosarm either contain none or contain other unrelated substances. Social media has played an important role in facilitating the widespread non-medical use of SARMs. </p> <p>Enobosarm is not approved for any medical use and is not available as a licensed pharmaceutical drug as of 2023. </p> <p>General side effects that have been reported with enobosarm in clinical trials include headache, fatigue, anemia, nausea, diarrhea, and back pain. </p><p>Enobosarm has shown dose-related adverse effects on serum lipids, sex hormone and gonadotropin levels, and carrier protein levels in clinical trials. It decreases HDL cholesterol levels, reducing them dose-dependently by 17% at a dose of 1&#160;mg/day and by 27% at a dose of 3&#160;mg/day. Decreases in total cholesterol levels and in triglyceride levels have also been seen, whereas LDL cholesterol levels are unchanged. In healthy elderly men, total testosterone levels decreased significantly at doses of 1 and 3&#160;mg/day (-31% and -57%, respectively), whereas levels of free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), estradiol, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) did not change significantly at doses up to 3&#160;mg/day. In healthy postmenopausal women, LH and FSH decreased significantly only at the 3&#160;mg/day dose (-17% and -30%, respectively), whereas levels of total testosterone, free testosterone, DHT, and estradiol did not clearly change relative to placebo. SHBG levels were lowered at doses of 1 to 3&#160;mg/day, decreasing dramatically by 61% in men and by 80% in women at the 3&#160;mg/day dose. For comparison, testosterone enanthate by intramuscular injection at a highly <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/supraphysiological\" title=\"wikt:supraphysiological\">supraphysiological</a> dose of 600&#160;mg/week resulted in only a 31% decrease in SHBG levels. Despite the large changes in SHBG levels, levels of free testosterone did not significantly change in either men or women. Small but significant increases in hemoglobin and hematocrit, and small but significant decreases in fasting blood glucose, insulin levels, and insulin resistance, have been observed with enobosarm at 3&#160;mg/day. </p><p>In small short-term (3-month) clinical trials in healthy elderly or postmenopausal women, enobosarm at doses ranging from 0.1 to 3&#160;mg/day had mixed effects on sebum production and did not increase body hair growth or cause hirsutism. These effects are measures of androgenic action in skin and hair follicles. In the first study, at doses of 0.1 to 3&#160;mg/day, there were no significant changes relative to placebo in sebum tape scores with enobosarm and there were no consistent increases in Ferriman–Gallwey score, with most women having no change in score or a decreased score and only one having an increase in score. In the second study, which employed 3&#160;mg/day enobosarm, there was a significant 1.25-fold increase in sebum production from baseline and a significant 1.5-fold increase in sebum production relative to placebo. No differences in sebaceous gland volume were apparent upon histological examination in this study. </p><p>At doses ranging from 0.1 to 18&#160;mg/day in clinical trials, enobosarm has been associated with elevated liver enzymes in subsets of individuals. Rates of elevated liver enzymes or of elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have ranged from 0.6% to 33% in these trials. Liver enzyme elevations with enobosarm are often transient and resolve spontaneously. However, markedly elevated liver enzymes have occasionally occurred with enobosarm in clinical trials and have necessitated discontinuation. There have been several published case reports of hepatotoxicity with enobosarm as of 2023. Between 2020 and 2022, there has been a rapid increase in reported cases of liver toxicity with SARMs. The hepatotoxicity with SARMs may be related to their resistance to hepatic metabolism, analogously to the case of 17α-alkylated anabolic steroids. </p><p>SARMs are often advertised and sold on the Internet at doses higher than have been described in the literature. Sometimes doses are recommended as several-fold or more greater than the doses used in clinical trials, or seemingly arbitrary doses are advised. For instance, enobosarm has been provided at doses of greater than or equal to 20&#160;mg per serving and recommended by bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts at doses of 10 to 30&#160;mg/day, relative to the most widely assessed highest dose in clinical trials of 3&#160;mg/day—an up to 10-fold difference. SARMs, particularly when used at high or excessive doses for prolonged periods of time, may result in substantial suppression of endogenous sex hormones like testosterone and estradiol, in turn producing widespread unintended deleterious effects on physiological function. As examples, SARMs may produce potent anabolic effects with deficiency in important androgenic effects, may result in estrogen deficiency with consequences like bone loss among others, and, due to suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis), may cause infertility. </p><p>Androgens and anabolic steroids like testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), nandrolone, and oxandrolone, which are full agonists of the androgen receptor, produce virilizing or masculinizing effects like increased sebum production and acne, increased body hair growth, scalp hair loss, voice deepening, increased muscle mass, android fat redistribution, skeletal changes like widening of the shoulders and skull/facial changes, and genital growth both in males and females. SARMs, which are tissue-selective mixed or partial agonists of the androgen receptor, are largely uncharacterized in terms of their masculinizing effects, but are likely to produce many of the same effects. SARMs specifically may be expected to retain masculinizing effects like increased muscle mass and bone changes, while possibly having reduced virilizing effects in certain other areas like androgenic skin and hair changes. Anecdotal reports of masculinization with SARMs in women exist in online forums. </p><p>The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cautioned that SARMs could have serious adverse effects ranging from risk of heart attack to stroke and liver damage and has warned against their use in bodybuilding products. </p> <p>Enobosarm has been assessed in clinical trials at doses ranging from 0.1 to 18&#160;mg/day. However, most research has been done at doses of 0.1 to 3&#160;mg/day, with two phase 3 clinical trials using a dosage of 3&#160;mg/day. A few small phase 1 and phase 2 trials of enobosarm for breast cancer have employed doses of 9 to 18&#160;mg/day. Larger, phase 3 trials of enobosarm at a dose of 9&#160;mg/day for breast cancer (e.g., ARTEST, n=210) are now underway. Doses of up to 100&#160;mg have been assessed in single-dose pharmacokinetic studies and doses of up to 30&#160;mg/day have been given in short 14-day pharmacokinetic studies. Enobosarm sold via black-market Internet suppliers and used non-medically is often taken at much higher doses than those used widely in clinical trials (e.g., 10–30&#160;mg/day), with unknown adverse effects and risks. </p> <p>Enobosarm is a substrate of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 and the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes UGT1A1 and UGT2B7. It shows very minimal metabolism by cytochrome P50 enzymes, with CYP3A4 merely responsible for the greatest degree of metabolism. Since enobosarm is metabolized by CYP3A4, UGT1A1, and UGT2B7, inhibitors and inducers of these enzymes can modify the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of enobosarm. The strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole was shown to have minimal to no influence on the pharmacokinetics of enobosarm, whereas the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampin reduced enobosarm peak levels by 23%, elimination half-life by 23%, and area-under-the-curve levels by 43%. The pan-UGT inhibitor probenecid was shown to not affect peak levels of enobosarm but to increase the elimination half-life of enobosarm by 78% and to increase area-under-the-curve levels of enobosarm by 50%. Enobosarm had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of celecoxib (a CYP2C9 substrate) or rosuvastatin (a BCRP substrate). Based on the preceding findings, it was concluded that enobosarm poses low risk for clinically relevant drug interactions. </p> <p>Enobosarm is a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM), or a tissue-selective mixed agonist or partial agonist of the androgen receptor (AR). This receptor is the biological target of endogenous androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and of synthetic anabolic steroids like nandrolone and oxandrolone. The affinity (K<sub>i</sub>) of enobosarm for the AR is high and was measured as 3.8&#160;nM in one study, or approximately 16.8% of that of DHT. Enobosarm shows enantioselectivity for the AR and has similar but somewhat lower potency than DHT in terms of activating the receptor. In addition to general activation of the AR, enobosarm induces the N/C interaction (the interaction of the amino terminus and carboxyl terminus) of the AR less potently than does DHT, but in any case promotes the N/C interaction concentration-dependently and to the same maximal extent as DHT. The AR is widely expressed in tissues throughout the body, including in the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, genitals, gonads, skin, hair follicles, muscle, bone, heart, adrenal cortex, liver, kidneys, and brain, among others. The effects of SARMs including enobosarm in many of these tissues have yet to be characterized. In any case, enobosarm has been demonstrated to have varying full agonist or partial agonist or antagonist actions in specific tissues, including potent agonistic and anabolic effects in muscle and bone, potent agonistic effects in AR-expressing human breast cancer cell lines like MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, and partially agonistic or antagonistic effects in the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and uterus. Enobosarm has additionally been shown to stimulate sexual motivation in female rats similarly to testosterone. Although enobosarm has not been specifically assessed in this area, another structurally unrelated quinolinone SARM, LGD-2226, has shown prosexual effects in male rats comparable to those of the synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid fluoxymesterone as well. </p><p>The molecular mechanisms underlying the tissue-selective effects of enobosarm and other SARMs compared to testosterone and other androgens and anabolic steroids remain unknown. However, recruitment of both coactivators and corepressors instead of only coactivators and resultant differing receptor conformations, distinct tissue-specific modulation of signaling pathways mediating genomic and non-genomic effects, and differences in within-tissue ligand metabolism and modulation of ligand potency (i.e., potentiation versus lack thereof), among others, all constitute possible mechanisms. In terms of coregulator recruitment, the ratios of coactivators to corepressors vary in different tissues throughout the body, and it is thought that SARMs may have agonistic effects in tissues with an excess of coactivators relative to corepressors like muscle and bone and may have partially agonistic or antagonistic effects in tissues with an excess of corepressors over coactivators like the prostate. Another mechanism may be that SARMs like enobosarm induce the N/C interaction less readily than AR full agonists like DHT. Induction of the N/C interaction has been associated with the effects of endogenous and exogenous AR agonists, for instance virilization and prostate growth. </p><p>In animal studies, enobosarm has shown potent muscle-promoting effects that were similar to those of testosterone and DHT. In one of the first published studies, enobosarm maximally restored prostate weight to 51%, seminal vesicle weight to 98%, and levator ani muscle weight to 136% in castrated male rats relative to gonadally intact control male rats, with an <a href=\"/wiki/Effective_dose_(pharmacology)\" title=\"Effective dose (pharmacology)\">ED<sub>50</sub></a> dose for muscle of 0.03&#160;mg/day. For comparison, testosterone propionate was able to maximally stimulate levator ani muscle to 104% and prostate weight to 121%, with ED<sub>50</sub> doses of 0.15&#160;mg/day and 0.13&#160;mg/day, respectively. Hence, enobosarm was able to stimulate the levator ani muscle to a size greater than that in normal male rats or produced with exogenous testosterone in castrated male rats, but was only capable of partially rescuing prostate gland weight. Additionally, enobosarm fully maintained or restored levator ani weight at doses that did not affect LH or FSH levels in gonadally intact animals (≤0.1&#160;mg/day). As such, it was more potent in stimulating muscle than testosterone at doses that did not affect gonadotropin levels. In gonadally intact male rats, enobosarm significantly increased levator ani muscle weight to 131% of intact controls but significantly decreased the weights of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles, demonstrating an antagonistic or partially agonistic effect in these tissues. In another animal study, enobosarm and DHT increased levator ani weights to similar or slightly different extents in intact male rats, but DHT strongly increased prostate weight while enobosarm reduced prostate weight. Aside from effects in muscle tissue, enobosarm has been assessed and found to completely maintain bone quality and composition in castrated male rats and to partially but not fully prevent bone loss in ovariectomized female rats, indicating potent anabolic effects in bone as well. </p><p>In a phase 2 human clinical trial in healthy elderly men and postmenopausal women, enobosarm dose-dependently increased lean body mass (muscle mass) across doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3&#160;mg/day, with a significant 1.3&#160;kg gain over placebo at 3&#160;mg/day and a non-significant 0.7&#160;kg gain over placebo at 1&#160;mg/day. Similarly, in two phase 3 clinical trials in men and postmenopausal women with muscle wasting due to non-small-cell lung cancer, enobosarm at 3&#160;mg/day significantly increased lean body mass by 0.41&#160;kg and 0.47&#160;kg. However, enobosarm did not successfully increase muscle strength in these phase 3 trials. In any case, it has been suggested that the study designs and physical function outcomes in such trials may have been flawed. The increases in lean body mass that have been seen with employed doses of enobosarm in clinical trials are very modest compared to those produced with supraphysiological doses of testosterone over similar timeframes (e.g., 0.5–1.5&#160;kg with enobosarm versus 5–8&#160;kg with 300–600&#160;mg/week intramuscular testosterone enanthate in healthy young men). The effects of higher doses of enobosarm (9–18&#160;mg/day) on lean body mass and muscle strength are also being evaluated in women with breast cancer. There is some evidence that women may be more sensitive to lean body mass increases with SARMs, specifically GSK-2881078 but potentially also others like enobosarm, than men. </p><p>In addition to its mixed agonist–antagonist activity at the AR, enobosarm is likely to also differ from steroidal androgens in its effects due to differences in within-tissue ligand metabolism. The virilizing and androgenic effects of the traditional steroidal androgens like testosterone in skin, hair follicles, and the prostate gland are attributed to high expression of 5α-reductase in these tissues and consequent local conversion and potentiation into more potent androgens. In the case of testosterone, this is via conversion into the 10-fold more potent androgen DHT. Enobosarm is not subject to this local transformation and potentiation, and so is theorized to have greatly reduced effects in these tissues relative to testosterone and certain other steroidal androgens. This is likewise theorized to be the case for non-5α-reductase-potentiated anabolic steroids like nandrolone and oxandrolone, which have high myotrophic–androgenic potency ratios in animals. The lack of 5α-reduction may result in reduced androgenic side effects like scalp hair loss, facial and body hair growth, and prostate growth. On the other hand, although SARMs, like enobosarm, as well as anabolic steroids, may have reduced virilizing effects in skin and hair follicles, this is not necessarily the case for virilization in general. In particular, the muscle-promoting effects of these agents can be considered a masculinizing effect. The potential masculinizing effects of enobosarm and SARMs in general are largely uncharacterized and unknown. Aside from metabolism differences related to 5α-reduction, enobosarm has also shown much greater impact in the liver, specifically on certain aspects of hepatic protein synthesis like reduction of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) production, than even highly <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/supraphysiological\" title=\"wikt:supraphysiological\">supraphysiological</a> doses of parenteral testosterone. This phenomenon has also been seen with other SARMs, such as LGD-4033, as well as with synthetic orally active 17α-alkylated anabolic steroids like stanozolol. It can be attributed to the first pass through the liver with oral administration and to the high oral bioavailability and strong resistance to hepatic metabolism of these agents. </p><p>Enobosarm has no estrogenic activity, either intrinsic to itself or via its metabolites. As a result, the drug is not expected to have feminizing effects or risk of gynecomastia (breast development) nor to stimulate estrogen-sensitive breast cancer. SARMs like enobosarm are not ideal agents for androgen replacement therapy as they are not expected to reproduce the full spectrum of effects of testosterone and other androgens, including not only AR-mediated effects but also notably aromatization into estrogen and required physiological estrogenic effects in bone and brain. Enobosarm has been found to be a weak antagonist of the progesterone receptor and hence might have some capacity for antiprogestogenic effects. Aside from its weak interaction with the progesterone receptor, enobosarm is highly selective for the AR and does not bind to other nuclear hormone receptors. </p> <p>Enobosarm is orally bioavailable due to a lack of extensive first-pass metabolism. In rats, the oral bioavailability of enobosarm was found to be 100%. Enobosarm is rapidly absorbed with oral administration and reaches maximal concentrations median 1.0&#160;hours (range 1.0–2.0&#160;hours) following administration. The drug reaches a peak concentration of 56.0&#160;ng/mL (range 53.1–123.0&#160;ng/mL) following a single 3&#160;mg dose and a steady-state peak of 68.1&#160;ng/mL following repeated 3&#160;mg doses. The pharmacokinetics of enobosarm are linear and proportional over a dose range of 1 to 100&#160;mg in single doses in healthy men. The pharmacokinetics of enobosarm are similar in young versus elderly individuals. A <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/concentration-time_curve\" title=\"wikt:concentration-time curve\">concentration–time curve</a> of enobosarm levels following a single oral dose of enobosarm in humans has been published. </p> <p>Enobosarm is a small-molecule and highly lipophilic compound. Compounds of this type are typically able to diffuse freely through biological membranes such as cell membranes and barriers like the blood–brain barrier. This is in fact essential for the action of nuclear receptor ligands like enobosarm since their biological targets (the androgen receptor in this case) are located intracellularly. One <i>in silico</i> study predicted that, on the basis of its overall physicochemical properties (but not considering active transport), enobosarm would be unlikely to cross the blood–brain barrier and hence would be a peripherally selective drug with reduced or no central nervous system effects. However, in a rat tissue distribution study, enobosarm was found to be concentrated in brain tissues to a similar extent as other target tissues like skeletal muscle, bone, prostate, and seminal vesicles. This is consistent with enobosarm producing centrally mediated effects in humans like suppression of LH and FSH secretion. </p><p>Enobosarm does not bind to sex hormone-binding globulin. </p> <p><i>In vitro</i> studies found very minimal metabolism of enobosarm by human cytochrome P450 enzymes. The greatest degree of oxidative metabolite generation occurred with CYP3A4. Upon incubation with human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes, enobosarm glucuronide was generated, with a majority of this inactive metabolite being produced by UGT1A1 and UGT2B7. Enobosarm glucuronide is the primary circulating metabolite of enobosarm. </p><p>Coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole had minimal impact on the pharmacokinetics of enobosarm and enobosarm glucuronide, whereas the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampin reduced enobosarm peak levels by 23%, elimination half-life by 23%, and area-under-the-curve levels by 43%. Coadministration of the pan-UGT inhibitor probenecid with enobosarm resulted in similar peak levels of enobosarm but the elimination half-life of enobosarm was extended by 78% and area-under-the-curve levels increased by 50%. These data are consistent with the preclinical findings that enobosarm is a substrate of CYP3A4 and UGT enzymes. </p><p>The metabolism of enobosarm is similar to that of the closely structurally related drug bicalutamide. </p> <p>In rats, enobosarm was excreted approximately 70% in feces and 21 to 25% in urine. </p><p>Enobosarm has an elimination half-life of approximately 14 to 24&#160;hours in human volunteers. In one pharmacokinetic study, the mean terminal half-life was 22.0 ± 5.8 (SD) hours, with a range of 13.7 to 31.3&#160;hours in different individuals </p> <p>Enobosarm is a small-molecule (molecular weight = 389.3&#160;g/mol) and highly lipophilic (predicted log P = 2.7–3.3) compound. </p><p>Enobosarm and related SARMs like acetothiolutamide, andarine (acetamidoxolutamide; GTx-007; S-4), and GTx-027 were derived from structural modification of the arylpropionamide nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide. They are nonsteroidal arylpropionamides themselves and are close structural analogues of bicalutamide. Bicalutamide was used to derive acetothiolutamide, andarine was developed from acetothiolutamide, the SARM S-1 was developed from andarine, and finally enobosarm was developed from S-1. Bicalutamide is used clinically as an antiandrogen, but there is some evidence that bicalutamide itself may have some SARM-like properties in certain tissues, for instance in muscle and bone. </p><p>Enobosarm (S-22) and andarine (S-4) and their chemical structures have sometimes been confused. The chemical structure of enobosarm was not disclosed until November 2011. </p><p>Novel nonsteroidal antiandrogens have been developed from enobosarm with enhanced potency and activity relative to conventional antiandrogens like bicalutamide and enzalutamide. </p> <p>The first SARMs were arylpropionamides derived from the nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide. They were discovered by James T. Dalton and colleagues at the University of Tennessee and other institutions and were first described in a paper published in 1998. At the time, these AR agonists were referred to as \"nonsteroidal androgens\", a drug class that had not been previously described. By 1999 however, on the basis of the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM)-like mixed agonist–antagonist and tissue-selective activity of these nonsteroidal AR agonists, the term \"selective androgen receptor modulator\" or \"SARM\" was introduced and adoption of this name had begun. The arylpropionamide SARM andarine (GTx-007; S-4) was first described in the literature by 2002. In 2003, arylpropionamide AR agonists, including andarine, were first reported to possess SARM-type tissue selectivity <i>in vivo</i>. Enobosarm (GTx-024; S-22), another arylpropionamide SARM, was first identified in 2004 and was first described in the literature in 2005. GTx, a pharmaceutical company founded in Memphis, Tennessee in 1997, licensed the rights to enobosarm from the University of Tennessee Research Foundation and began developing it as a pharmaceutical drug. </p><p>A phase 1 clinical trial employing enobosarm had been completed by 2005. By 2007, enobosarm was in a phase 2 trial, and that year GTx signed an exclusive license agreement for its SARM program with Merck &amp; Co. The companies ended the deal in 2010. In August 2011, there was a 12-week double-blind, placebo controlled phase 2 trial that focused on elderly men and postmenopausal women which concluded that enobosarm showed statistically significant improvements in total lean body mass and physical function without apparent adverse effects on hair growth or sebum production. In August 2013, GTx announced that enobosarm had failed in two phase 3 clinical trials to treat wasting in people with lung cancer. The company had invested around $35 million in the development of the drug. The company said at that time that it planned to pursue approval of enobosarm in Europe; the company was also still developing GTx-758, a nonsteroidal estrogen, for castration-resistant prostate cancer. As of 2018, enobosarm was the only SARM to have reached or completed phase 3 clinical trials. </p><p>In 2016, GTx began phase 2 trials, to see if enobosarm might be effective to treat stress urinary incontinence in women. In 2018, GTx announced the phase 2 trials on the effectiveness of enobosarm for stress urinary incontinence in women failed to achieve its primary endpoint in the ASTRID Trial. By September 2023, development of enobosarm for stress urinary incontinence had been discontinued. In 2022, the FDA granted fast tract designation to enobosarm in AR+, ER+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer. In January 2024, Veru Inc. submitted an Investigational New Drug application to the FDA of enobosarm for prevention of muscle loss and augmentation of fat loss in combination with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists like semaglutide for weight loss. In addition, they announced plans to conduct a phase 2b study of enobosarm at doses of 3 to 6&#160;mg/day for this purpose in sarcopenic obese or overweight elderly individuals receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists. </p><p>Enobosarm was developed by GTx, Inc., and is now being developed by Veru, Inc. </p> <div><h2 >Society and culture</h2><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Enobosarm&action=edit&section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Society and culture\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Enobosarm is the generic name of the drug and its International Nonproprietary Name (INN). Ostarine was a tentative brand name of the drug created by GTx, Inc. that did not end up being used for marketing purposes but continues to be used as a synonym for the drug. Enobosarm is also known by the pharmaceutical developmental code names S-22 (synthesis paper), GTx-024 (GTx, Inc.), MK-2866 (Merck), and VERU-024 (Veru, Inc.). </p> <p>Enobosarm and other SARMs are sold by black-market vendors on the Internet. These agents have increasingly become used by the general public as \"gym supplements\" such as pre-workout or lifestyle drugs, rather than as an aid to performance in athletic or bodybuilding competitions. In one survey, 2.7% of young male gym users in the Netherlands reported using SARMs. In addition, a 2018 analysis of a fatberg from a sewer in central London showed enobosarm to be the most abundant \"pharmaceutical drug\" detected, and was present at higher concentration than recreational drugs such as MDMA and cocaine. While this isolated result may not be representative of overall levels of use, for enobosarm to be detectable in sewer deposits reflects significant levels of enobosarm use in the area close to where the sample was collected. Doses of enobosarm sold online and used non-medically are often many times higher than those assessed in clinical trials. Aside from enobosarm, the other most commonly used SARMs include vosilasarm (RAD140; \"testolone\"), LGD-4033 (VK5211; \"ligandrol\"), and andarine (GTx-007; S-4). Many products sold online that are purported to be enobosarm either contain none or contain other unrelated substances, and doses are also frequently not as labeled. Social media has played an important role in facilitating the widespread non-medical use of SARMs. </p> <p>SARMs including enobosarm may be and have been used by athletes to assist in training and increase physical stamina and fitness, potentially producing effects similar to anabolic steroids. For this reason, SARMs were banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency in January 2008, despite no drugs from this class yet being in clinical use, and blood tests for all known SARMs have been developed. There are a variety of known cases of doping in sports with enobosarm by professional athletes. </p> <div><h4 >List of doping cases</h4><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Enobosarm&action=edit&section=18\" title=\"Edit section: List of doping cases\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>In May 2017, Dynamic Technical Formulations voluntarily recalled all lots of Tri-Ton, a dietary supplement that the FDA tested and found to contain Enobosarm and andarine. </p><p>In October 2018, UFC fighter Sean O'Malley tested positive for Enobosarm and was suspended by the Nevada State Athletic Commission and USADA for six months. O'Malley tested positive again on May 25, 2019 and was suspended for nine months by the same agencies. USADA determined that none of O'Malley's positive tests were consistent with intentional use and he was allowed to compete at UFC 248 as long as he kept his levels below the threshold of 100&#160;ng/ml. </p><p>On January 7, 2019, the College National Football Championship was played between University of Alabama and Clemson University. Prior to the College Football National Championship game, three Clemson players who were suspended —</span> Dexter Lawrence, Braden Galloway and Zach Giellaall —</span> tested positive for a substance known as enobosarm. On June 23, 2019 Clemson did not release enobosarm investigation findings, citing privacy law. </p><p>In July 2019, National Football League player Taylor Lewan failed a drug test for Enobosarm, which Lewan claimed he ingested accidentally as an unlabeled ingredient in a supplement. </p><p>On October&#160;23, 2020, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) announced that the Italian rider Matteo Spreafico has been notified of two adverse analytical findings (AAFs) for Enobosarm in two samples collected during the Giro d'Italia on 15–16 October 2020. </p><p>On July&#160;6, 2021, during the 2020 Summer Olympics, Brazil women's national volleyball team player Tandara was temporarily suspended for testing positive for enobosarm. The test was carried out and identified by the Brazilian Doping Control Authority (ABDC). </p><p>On August&#160;12, 2021, after the 2020 Summer Olympics, Chijindu \"CJ\" Ujah, A member of the silver medal-winning British 4×100 relay team was temporarily suspended for testing positive for both enobosarm and S-23. The sample was collected post event by the International Testing Agency (ITA) and confirmed two days later as positive. The case was referred to the anti-doping division of the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Finally in February 2022, Great Britain were stripped of their silver medal. In October 2022, Ujah was suspended for 22 months by the ITA. </p><p>In October 2021, two Thoroughbred horses named Arafat and Komunist tested positive for enobosarm after races at Woodbine Racetrack. In a decision of the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario issued May 30, 2022, the horses were declared unplaced in the races in question, and their trainer Robert Gerl was fined $100,000 (as well as forfeiting prize money) and suspended from racing for 20 years. </p><p>In May 2022, National Football League Wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins was suspended six games without pay by the NFL for violating the league's performance-enhancing drug policy. According to Hopkins, he tested positive for enobosarm. </p><p>In April 2023, British boxer Amir Khan was banned for two years after an anti-doping test revealed the presence of enobosarm following his fight against Kell Brook in February 2022. </p><p>On May 1, 2024, American boxer Ryan Garcia tested positive for the performance-enhancing substance Ostarine the day before and the day of his upset win over Devin Haney last month, per a Voluntary Anti-Doping Association letter sent to all parties Wednesday and obtained by ESPN. The samples were taken prior to the fight, but the results weren't known until later. Garcia's A-sample also screened positive for 19-norandrosterone, but its presence is unconfirmed at this time. Garcia floored Haney three times during the majority decision victory, but that result could possibly be overturned because his B-sample tested positive on May 22, 2024. Garcia's fate now rests in the hands of the New York State Athletic Commission, which will adjudicate any suspensions and financial penalties. Sanctions also include the possibility of his win over Haney being overturned to a no-contest or having it changed to a disqualification. Despite his \"B\" samples returning positive results, Garcia has maintained his innocence and has cited substance contamination. </p> <p>Enobosarm is currently under development for the treatment of breast cancer. It was also previously under development for a variety of other potential uses, including treatment of cachexia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, muscle atrophy or sarcopenia, and stress incontinence. However, development for all other indications has been discontinued. </p><p>Enobosarm was assessed for the treatment of muscle wasting in people with lung cancer in two phase 3 clinical trials. The findings of these trials were reported in 2013. Enobosarm significantly improved lean body mass in the trials, but it was not effective in improving muscle strength, as measured by stair climb power. Consequent to these findings, enobosarm did not gain regulatory approval, and development for this use was terminated. Enobosarm had originally been under development for the treatment of sarcopenia (age-related muscle atrophy). However, the FDA requested a cardiovascular safety study be conducted to proceed with phase 3 trials for this indication. The developer of enobosarm refused to conduct this study due to the considerable costs that would be involved. Instead, it opted to trial enobosarm for muscle wasting in cachexia patients, in whom the FDA was more tolerant to cardiovascular side effects and did not require cardiovascular safety evaluation. </p><p>Following negative findings for muscle wasting, enobosarm was evaluated for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence in postmenopausal women. It was expected that enobosarm might be effective for this use by strengthening the pelvic floor muscles. Enobosarm reached phase 2 clinical trials for this indication, but development was discontinued due to lack of effectiveness in a phase 2 study. </p><p>Subsequently, enobosarm was repurposed again for the treatment of androgen receptor-positive (AR+) estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. As of November 2023, it is in phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of this type of breast cancer. Increases in lean body mass and muscle strength as a secondary benefit with enobosarm are also being evaluated in these women. These trials are notably employing several-fold higher doses of enobosarm than were assessed in the muscle wasting phase 3 trials (9&#160;mg/day versus 3&#160;mg/day, respectively). </p><p>In January 2024, it was announced that enobosarm was being developed for prevention of muscle wasting and augmentation of fat loss in combination with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists like semaglutide for weight loss. A phase 2b clinical trial for this indication with 3 to 6&#160;mg/day enobosarm in sarcopenic obese or overweight elderly individuals is being prepared. </p><p>According to GTx, the original developer of enobosarm, a total of 25 clinical studies have been carried out on more than 1,700 people involving doses from 1 to 100&#160;mg as of 2020. However, enobosarm has not yet completed clinical development or been approved for any use. </p> <ul><li>List of investigational sex-hormonal agents § Androgenics</li></ul> <div><ol> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-1\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-2\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-3\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-4\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-5\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-6\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-7\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-8\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-9\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-10\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-11\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-12\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-13\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-14\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-15\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-16\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-17\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-18\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-19\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-20\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-AdisInsight_1-21\"></a> <cite><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800022562\">\"Enobosarm - GTx\"</a>. <i>Adis Insight</i>.

Early on, GTx-024 appeared to have a very bright future as a treatment for sarcopenia/cachexia. Preliminary clinical trials demonstrated that GTx-024 could increase lean body mass and improve physical function without androgenic side effects (27). However, Enobosarm was dealt a blow after the phase III Prevention and treatment Of muscle Wasting in patients with cancER (POWER) I and II trials, where increases in lean body mass were once again observed, but without improved stair climb power (79,80). Failure to attain both primary endpoints led to a lack of approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has cast doubt on the previously charted course for SARMs and has tempered enthusiasm regarding the role of SARMs in the treatment of muscle wasting conditions.</q></cite></span> </li> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-1\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-2\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-3\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-4\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-5\"></a> <cite >Kim J, Wang R, Veverka KA, Dalton JT (November 2013). \"Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the novel SARM GTx-024 [(S)-N-(4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-3-(4-cyanophenoxy)-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanamide] in rats\". <i>Xenobiotica; the Fate of Foreign Compounds in Biological Systems</i>. <b>43</b> (11): 993–1009. doi:<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.3109%2F00498254.2013.788233\">10.3109/00498254.2013.788233</a>.

Enobosarm (GTx024) is the farthest along in clinical development, and demonstrates an agonist effect that in some populations inhibits BCa growth. Preclinical data show antitumor activity of GTx-024 in ARC stably expressing cell lines MCF-7 (ERC) and MDA-MB-231 (TNBC) implanted subcutaneously into nude mice. Tumor growth was reduced more than 75% in MDA-MB-231-AR cells and 50% in MCF-7-AR cells compared with vehicle-treated tumors, demonstrating benefit (Dalton et al. 2013).</q></cite></span> </li> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-1\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-2\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-3\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-4\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-5\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-6\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-7\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-8\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-9\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-10\"></a> <cite >Feingold KR, Anawalt B, Blackman MR, Boyce A, Chrousos G, Corpas E, et&#160;al.

This creates a new class of non-steroidal synthetic androgen, often termed Specific Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARM), a misleading marketing term rather than an accurate pharmacological description [113,114], usurping a speculative but unsound analogy with Specific Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERM). [...] none of the non-steroidal androgens under development [116,117] are marketed by 2021. Yet hope springs eternal for this new attempt to separate anabolic from androgenic properties of androgens to facilitate marketing for muscle wasting and other selective effects of testosterone.</q></cite></span> </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid21511988_40-0\">^</a></b> <cite >Handelsman DJ (May 2011). \"Commentary: androgens and \"anabolic steroids\": the one-headed janus\". <i>Endocrinology</i>. <b>152</b> (5): 1752–1754. doi:<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1210%2Fen.2010-1501\">10.1210/en.2010-1501</a>.

One randomized controlled trial , recruited male and females with cancer and weight loss showed that enobosarm 1 mg or 3 mg was associated with significant increase in lean body mass compared to placebo. This led to another ongoing trial, with more selection, aiming to evaluate enobosarm (with higher doses 9 or 18 mg) effect on physical function and lean body mass of ER+/AR+ breast cancer patients (NCT02463032). Such additional action of this class of drugs carries major hope for patients with AR-positive advanced breast cancer, where weight loss, muscle weakness and physical inactivity represent a big challenge for the patient's quality of life (QOL).</q></cite></span> </li> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid37946721_44-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid37946721_44-1\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid37946721_44-2\"></a> <cite >Hackbart H, Cui X, Lee JS (October 2023). <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10632549\">\"Androgen receptor in breast cancer and its clinical implication\"</a>. <i>Translational Breast Cancer Research</i>. <b>4</b>: 30. doi:<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.21037%2Ftbcr-23-44\">10.21037/tbcr-23-44</a>.

[...] these compounds have several properties in common: they are small, very lipophilic molecules with the potential to freely diffuse through cell membranes. Their receptors also share important features: in all animals, the receptors for steroid hormones are part of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-triggered transcription factors (Mangelsdorf et al. 1995). Unlike membrane receptors that trigger intracellular signalling pathways, these receptors work by influencing gene expression in the cell.</q></cite></span> </li> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid34218646_75-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid34218646_75-1\"></a> <cite >Yoon JH, Kwon KS (June 2021). <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8258343\">\"Receptor-Mediated Muscle Homeostasis as a Target for Sarcopenia Therapeutics\"</a>. <i>Endocrinology and Metabolism</i>. <b>36</b> (3): 478–490. doi:<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.3803%2FEnM.2021.1081\">10.3803/EnM.2021.1081</a>.

Ligands of intracellular receptors include lipophilic vitamins, steroid hormones, and small chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide, which require membrane permeability for intracellular delivery [30,31]. There are several barriers to the intracellular delivery of therapeutic drugs, such as lysosome degradation and active efflux out of the cell. Lowmolecular-weight lipophilic compounds can diffuse directly into cells, whereas high-molecular-weight compounds usually need membrane transporters or endocytosis [32,33]. Proper entry into the cell and subsequent contact with the exact target lead to better therapeutic effects and reduce undesirable adverse effects .</q></cite></span> </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-pmid23881885_76-0\">^</a></b> <cite >Mohd Fauzi F, Koutsoukas A, Cunningham A, Gallegos A, Sedefov R, Bender A (July 2013). \"Computer-aided (in silico) approaches in the mode-of-action analysis and safety assessment of ostarine and 4-methylamphetamine\". <i>Human Psychopharmacology</i>. <b>28</b> (4): 365–378. doi:<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002%2Fhup.2322\">10.1002/hup.2322</a>.

also formerly known as **ostarine** and by the developmental code names **GTx-024**, **MK-2866**, and **S-22**, is a [selective androgen receptor modulator](/wiki/Selective_androgen_receptor_modulator) (SARM) which is under development for the treatment of [androgen receptor-positive](/wiki/Hormone_sensitive_cancer) [breast cancer](/wiki/Breast_cancer) in women and for improvement of [body composition](/wiki/Body_composition) (e.g., prevention of [muscle loss](/wiki/Muscle_loss)) in people taking [GLP-1 receptor

[semaglutide](/wiki/Semaglutide).[[1]](#cite_note-AdisInsight-1)[[5]](#cite_note-pmid24490605-5)[[7]](#cite_note-JonesCossSteinerDalton2013-7)[[8]](#cite_note-pmid36972361-8)[[9]](#cite_note-Biospace2024-9) It was also under development for a variety of other indications, including treatment of [cachexia](/wiki/Cachexia), [Duchenne muscular dystrophy](/wiki/Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy), [muscle atrophy](/wiki/Muscle_atrophy) or [sarcopenia](/wiki/Sarcopenia), and [stress urinary incontinence](/wiki/Stress_incontinence), but development for all other uses has been discontinued.[[1]](#cite_note-AdisInsight-1)[[10]](#cite_note-pmid32476495-10)[[2]](#cite_note-pmid32257854-2) Enobosarm was evaluated for the treatment of [muscle wasting](/wiki/Muscle_wasting) related to [cancer](/wiki/Cancer) in [late-stage](/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_III) [clinical trials](/wiki/Clinical_trial), and the drug improved [lean body mass](/wiki/Lean_body_mass) in

[fatigue](/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)), [anemia](/wiki/Anemia), [nausea](/wiki/Nausea), [diarrhea](/wiki/Diarrhea), [back pain](/wiki/Back_pain), adverse [lipid](/wiki/Lipid) changes like decreased [high-density lipoprotein](/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein) (HDL) [cholesterol](/wiki/Cholesterol) levels, changes in [sex hormone](/wiki/Sex_hormone) concentrations like decreased [testosterone](/wiki/Testosterone) levels, [elevated liver enzymes](/wiki/Elevated_liver_enzymes), and [liver toxicity](/wiki/Liver_toxicity), among others.[[6]](#cite_note-pmid19852734-6)[[14]](#cite_note-pmid33672087-14)[[15]](#cite_note-pmid30503797-15)[[16]](#cite_note-pmid26401842-16)[[12]](#cite_note-pmid36479151-12) The potential [masculinizing](/wiki/Virilization) effects of enobosarm, for instance in women, have largely not been evaluated and are unknown.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17) The potential [adverse effects](/wiki/Adverse_effect) and risks of high doses of enobosarm are also unknown.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17) Enobosarm is a [nonsteroidal](/wiki/Nonsteroidal) SARM, acting as an [agonist](/wiki/Agonist) of the [androgen receptor](/wiki/Androgen_receptor) (AR), the [biological target](/wiki/Biological_target) of [androgens](/wiki/Androgen) and [anabolic steroids](/wiki/Anabolic_steroid) like [testosterone](/wiki/Testosterone_(medication)) and [dihydrotestosterone](/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone) (DHT).[[10]](#cite_note-pmid32476495-10) However, it shows dissociation of effect between tissues in [preclinical studies](/wiki/Preclinical_research), with agonistic and [anabolic](/wiki/Anabolic) effects in muscle and bone, agonistic effects in [breast](/wiki/Breast), and [partially agonistic](/wiki/Partial_agonist) or [antagonistic](/wiki/Receptor_antagonist) effects in the [prostate gland](/wiki/Prostate_gland) and [seminal vesicles](/wiki/Seminal_vesicles).[[7]](#cite_note-JonesCossSteinerDalton2013-7)[[10]](#cite_note-pmid32476495-10)[[2]](#cite_note-pmid32257854-2)[[18]](#cite_note-MohlerNair2005-18)[[19]](#cite_note-pmid25722318-19) The AR-mediated effects of enobosarm in many other androgen-sensitive tissues are unknown.[[18]](#cite_note-MohlerNair2005-18)[[20]](#cite_note-pmid25905231-20)\nEnobosarm was first identified in 2004[[11]](#cite_note-pmid27535042-11) and has been under clinical development since at least 2005.[[1]](#cite_note-AdisInsight-1)[[18]](#cite_note-MohlerNair2005-18) It is the most well-studied SARM of all of the agents that have been developed.[[21]](#cite_note-ZajacSeeman2020-21) According to GTx, its developer, a total of 25 clinical studies have been carried out on more than 1,700 people involving doses from 1 to 100&#160;mg as of 2020.[[10]](#cite_note-pmid32476495-10)[[22]](#cite_note-Biospace2016-22) However, enobosarm has not yet completed clinical development or been approved for any use.[[1]](#cite_note-AdisInsight-1)[[2]](#cite_note-pmid32257854-2) As of November 2023, it is in [phase 3](/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_III) [clinical trials](/wiki/Clinical_trial) for the treatment of breast cancer and is in [phase 2](/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_II) studies for improvement of body composition in people taking GLP-1 receptor agonists.[[1]](#cite_note-AdisInsight-1)[[9]](#cite_note-Biospace2024-9) Enobosarm was developed by [GTx, Inc.](/wiki/GTx_Incorporated), and is now being developed by Veru, Inc.[[1]](#cite_note-AdisInsight-1)\nAside from its development as a potential [pharmaceutical drug](/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug), enobosarm is on the [World Anti-Doping Agency](/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency) [list of prohibited substances](/wiki/List_of_drugs_banned_by_the_World_Anti-Doping_Agency) and is sold for [physique- and performance-enhancing](/wiki/Performance-enhancing_substance) purposes by black-market Internet suppliers.[[10]](#cite_note-pmid32476495-10)[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17) In one survey, 2.7% of young male gym users reported using SARMs.[[23]](#cite_note-pmid38059982-23) In addition, a London [wastewater analysis](/wiki/Wastewater_surveillance) found that enobosarm was the most abundant \"pharmaceutical drug\" detected and was more prevalent than \"classical\" [recreational drugs](/wiki/Recreational_drug) like [MDMA](/wiki/MDMA) and [cocaine](/wiki/Cocaine).[[24]](#cite_note-TheGuardian2018-24) Enobosarm is often used in these contexts at doses greatly exceeding those evaluated in clinical trials, with unknown effectiveness and [safety](/wiki/Drug_safety).[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17) Many products sold online that are purported to be enobosarm either contain none or contain other unrelated substances.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[25]](#cite_note-pmid29183075-25) [Social media](/wiki/Social_media) has played an important role in facilitating the widespread non-medical use of SARMs.[[26]](#cite_note-pmid35574698-26)\n\nEnobosarm is not approved for any medical use and is not available as a licensed [pharmaceutical drug](/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug) as of 2023.[[1]](#cite_note-AdisInsight-1)[[2]](#cite_note-pmid32257854-2)[[10]](#cite_note-pmid32476495-10)[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)\n\nGeneral [side effects](/wiki/Side_effect) that have been reported with enobosarm in clinical trials include [headache](/wiki/Headache), [fatigue](/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)), [anemia](/wiki/Anemia), [nausea](/wiki/Nausea), [diarrhea](/wiki/Diarrhea), and [back

on [serum lipids](/wiki/Serum_lipids), [sex hormone](/wiki/Sex_hormone) and [gonadotropin](/wiki/Gonadotropin) levels, and [carrier protein](/wiki/Carrier_protein) levels in clinical trials.[[16]](#cite_note-pmid26401842-16)[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[28]](#cite_note-pmid22031847-28) It decreases [HDL cholesterol](/wiki/HDL_cholesterol) levels, reducing them dose-dependently by 17% at a dose of 1&#160;mg/day and by 27% at a dose of 3&#160;mg/day.[[16]](#cite_note-pmid26401842-16)[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[28]](#cite_note-pmid22031847-28) Decreases in [total cholesterol](/wiki/Total_cholesterol) levels and in [triglyceride](/wiki/Triglyceride) levels have also been seen, whereas [LDL cholesterol](/wiki/LDL_cholesterol) levels are unchanged.[[16]](#cite_note-pmid26401842-16)[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[28]](#cite_note-pmid22031847-28) In healthy elderly men, total [testosterone](/wiki/Testosterone) levels decreased significantly at doses of 1 and 3&#160;mg/day (-31% and -57%, respectively), whereas levels of free testosterone, [dihydrotestosterone](/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone) (DHT), [estradiol](/wiki/Estradiol), [luteinizing hormone](/wiki/Luteinizing_hormone) (LH), and [follicle-stimulating hormone](/wiki/Follicle-stimulating_hormone) (FSH) did not change significantly at doses up to 3&#160;mg/day.[[16]](#cite_note-pmid26401842-16)[[28]](#cite_note-pmid22031847-28) In healthy postmenopausal women, LH and FSH decreased significantly only at the 3&#160;mg/day dose (-17% and -30%, respectively), whereas levels of total testosterone, free testosterone, DHT, and estradiol did not clearly change relative to placebo.[[16]](#cite_note-pmid26401842-16)[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[28]](#cite_note-pmid22031847-28) SHBG levels were lowered at doses of 1 to 3&#160;mg/day, decreasing dramatically by 61% in men and by 80% in women at the 3&#160;mg/day dose.[[16]](#cite_note-pmid26401842-16)[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[28]](#cite_note-pmid22031847-28) For comparison, [testosterone enanthate](/wiki/Testosterone_enanthate) by [intramuscular injection](/wiki/Intramuscular_injection) at a highly [supraphysiological](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/supraphysiological) dose of 600&#160;mg/week resulted in only a 31% decrease in SHBG levels.[[28]](#cite_note-pmid22031847-28)[[29]](#cite_note-pmid8637535-29) Despite the large changes in SHBG levels, levels of free testosterone did not significantly change in either men or women.[[16]](#cite_note-pmid26401842-16)[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[28]](#cite_note-pmid22031847-28) Small but significant increases in [hemoglobin](/wiki/Hemoglobin) and [hematocrit](/wiki/Hematocrit), and small but significant decreases in [fasting blood glucose](/wiki/Blood_sugar_level), [insulin](/wiki/Insulin) levels, and [insulin resistance](/wiki/Insulin_resistance), have been observed with enobosarm at 3&#160;mg/day.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[30]](#cite_note-pmid24407183-30)[[28]](#cite_note-pmid22031847-28)[[6]](#cite_note-pmid19852734-6)\nIn small short-term (3-month) clinical trials in healthy elderly or postmenopausal women, enobosarm at doses ranging from 0.1 to 3&#160;mg/day had mixed effects on [sebum](/wiki/Sebum) production and did not increase [body hair](/wiki/Body_hair) [growth](/wiki/Hair_growth) or cause [hirsutism](/wiki/Hirsutism).[[31]](#cite_note-pmid24945109-31)[[28]](#cite_note-pmid22031847-28) These effects are measures of androgenic action in [skin](/wiki/Skin) and [hair follicles](/wiki/Hair_follicle).[[31]](#cite_note-pmid24945109-31) In the first study, at doses of 0.1 to 3&#160;mg/day, there were no significant changes relative to placebo in sebum tape scores with enobosarm and there were no consistent increases in [Ferriman–Gallwey score](/wiki/Ferriman%E2%80%93Gallwey_score), with most women having no change in score or a decreased score and only one having an increase in score.[[31]](#cite_note-pmid24945109-31)[[28]](#cite_note-pmid22031847-28) In the second study, which employed 3&#160;mg/day enobosarm, there was a significant 1.25-fold increase in sebum production from baseline and a significant 1.5-fold increase in sebum production relative to placebo.[[31]](#cite_note-pmid24945109-31) No differences in [sebaceous gland](/wiki/Sebaceous_gland) volume were apparent upon [histological](/wiki/Histology) examination in this study.[[31]](#cite_note-pmid24945109-31)\nAt doses ranging from 0.1 to 18&#160;mg/day in clinical trials, enobosarm has been associated with [elevated liver enzymes](/wiki/Elevated_liver_enzymes) in subsets of individuals.[[12]](#cite_note-pmid36479151-12)[[16]](#cite_note-pmid26401842-16) Rates of elevated liver enzymes or of elevated [alanine aminotransferase](/wiki/Alanine_aminotransferase) (ALT) levels have ranged from 0.6% to 33% in these trials.[[12]](#cite_note-pmid36479151-12)[[16]](#cite_note-pmid26401842-16) Liver enzyme elevations with enobosarm are often transient and resolve spontaneously.[[12]](#cite_note-pmid36479151-12) However, markedly elevated liver enzymes have occasionally occurred with enobosarm in clinical trials and have necessitated [discontinuation](/wiki/Drug_discontinuation).[[12]](#cite_note-pmid36479151-12) There have been several published [case reports](/wiki/Case_report) of [hepatotoxicity](/wiki/Hepatotoxicity) with enobosarm as of 2023.[[12]](#cite_note-pmid36479151-12)[[32]](#cite_note-pmid37218811-32)[[23]](#cite_note-pmid38059982-23)[[33]](#cite_note-pmid34368386-33)[[34]](#cite_note-pmid35655632-34)[[35]](#cite_note-pmid37871633-35)[[36]](#cite_note-pmid37501938-36) Between 2020 and 2022, there has been a rapid increase in reported cases of liver toxicity with SARMs.[[32]](#cite_note-pmid37218811-32) The hepatotoxicity with SARMs may be related to their resistance to [hepatic](/wiki/Liver) [metabolism](/wiki/Metabolism), analogously to the case of [17α-alkylated anabolic steroids](/wiki/17%CE%B1-alkylated_anabolic_steroid).[[12]](#cite_note-pmid36479151-12)\nSARMs are often advertised and sold on the Internet at doses higher than have been described in the literature.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[27]](#cite_note-pmid37571268-27) Sometimes doses are recommended as several-fold or more greater than the doses used in clinical trials, or seemingly arbitrary doses are advised.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[27]](#cite_note-pmid37571268-27) For instance, enobosarm has been provided at doses of greater than or equal to 20&#160;mg per serving and recommended by bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts at doses of 10 to 30&#160;mg/day, relative to the most widely assessed highest dose in clinical trials of 3&#160;mg/day—an up to 10-fold difference.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[27]](#cite_note-pmid37571268-27) SARMs, particularly when used at high or excessive doses for prolonged periods of time, may result in substantial suppression of [endogenous](/wiki/Endogenous) [sex hormones](/wiki/Sex_hormone) like [testosterone](/wiki/Testosterone) and [estradiol](/wiki/Estradiol), in turn producing widespread unintended deleterious effects on physiological function.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17) As examples, SARMs may produce potent anabolic effects with deficiency in important androgenic effects, may result in [estrogen deficiency](/wiki/Estrogen_deficiency) with consequences like [bone loss](/wiki/Osteoporosis) among others, and, due to suppression of the [hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis](/wiki/Hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary%E2%80%93gonadal_axis) (HPG axis), may cause [infertility](/wiki/Infertility).[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)\n[Androgens](/wiki/Androgen) and [anabolic steroids](/wiki/Anabolic_steroid) like [testosterone](/wiki/Testosterone_(medication)), [dihydrotestosterone](/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone) (DHT), [nandrolone](/wiki/Nandrolone), and [oxandrolone](/wiki/Oxandrolone), which are [full agonists](/wiki/Full_agonist) of the [androgen receptor](/wiki/Androgen_receptor), produce [virilizing](/wiki/Virilization) or [masculinizing](/wiki/Masculinization) effects like increased sebum production and [acne](/wiki/Acne), increased [body hair](/wiki/Body_hair) [growth](/wiki/Hair_growth), [scalp hair loss](/wiki/Scalp_hair_loss), [voice deepening](/wiki/Voice_deepening), increased [muscle mass](/wiki/Muscle_mass), [android fat redistribution](/wiki/Android_fat_distribution), skeletal changes like [widening of the shoulders](/wiki/Shoulder_broadening) and skull/facial changes, and [genital](/wiki/Genital) growth both in males and females.[[37]](#cite_note-pmid18500378-37)[[38]](#cite_note-Skinner2018-38)[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17) SARMs, which are [tissue-selective](/wiki/Tissue_selectivity) mixed or [partial agonists](/wiki/Partial_agonist) of the androgen receptor, are largely uncharacterized in terms of their masculinizing effects, but are likely to produce many of the same effects.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[37]](#cite_note-pmid18500378-37)[[39]](#cite_note-pmid35277356-39)[[40]](#cite_note-pmid21511988-40) SARMs specifically may be expected to retain masculinizing effects like increased muscle mass and bone changes, while possibly having reduced virilizing effects in certain other areas like androgenic skin and hair changes.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[16]](#cite_note-pmid26401842-16)[[31]](#cite_note-pmid24945109-31)[[18]](#cite_note-MohlerNair2005-18)[[20]](#cite_note-pmid25905231-20) [Anecdotal reports](/wiki/Anecdotal_report) of masculinization with SARMs in women exist in online forums.[[26]](#cite_note-pmid35574698-26)\nThe [United States](/wiki/United_States) [Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) (FDA) has cautioned that SARMs could have serious adverse effects ranging from risk of [heart attack](/wiki/Heart_attack) to [stroke](/wiki/Stroke) and [liver damage](/wiki/Liver_damage) and has warned against their use in [bodybuilding](/wiki/Bodybuilding) products.[[41]](#cite_note-FDA2017-41)\n\nEnobosarm has been assessed in clinical trials at doses ranging from 0.1 to 18&#160;mg/day.[[10]](#cite_note-pmid32476495-10) However, most research has been done at doses of 0.1 to 3&#160;mg/day, with two [phase 3](/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_III) clinical trials using a dosage of 3&#160;mg/day.[[2]](#cite_note-pmid32257854-2)[[15]](#cite_note-pmid30503797-15)[[32]](#cite_note-pmid37218811-32)[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17) A few small [phase 1](/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_I) and [phase 2](/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_II) trials of enobosarm for breast cancer have employed doses of 9 to 18&#160;mg/day.[[42]](#cite_note-pmid27729416-42)[[12]](#cite_note-pmid36479151-12)[[2]](#cite_note-pmid32257854-2)[[43]](#cite_note-KassemShohdy2019-43) Larger, phase 3 trials of enobosarm at a dose of 9&#160;mg/day for breast cancer (e.g., ARTEST, n=210) are now underway.[[44]](#cite_note-pmid37946721-44)[[45]](#cite_note-pmid37684290-45) Doses of up to 100&#160;mg have been assessed in single-dose [pharmacokinetic](/wiki/Pharmacokinetic) studies and doses of up to 30&#160;mg/day have been given in short 14-day pharmacokinetic studies.[[5]](#cite_note-pmid24490605-5) Enobosarm sold via black-market Internet suppliers and used non-medically is often taken at much higher doses than those used widely in clinical trials (e.g., 10–30&#160;mg/day), with unknown adverse effects and risks.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[27]](#cite_note-pmid37571268-27)\n\nEnobosarm is a [substrate](/wiki/Substrate_(biochemistry)) of the [cytochrome P450](/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) [enzyme](/wiki/Enzyme) [CYP3A4](/wiki/CYP3A4) and the [UDP-glucuronosyltransferase](/wiki/UDP-glucuronosyltransferase) (UGT) enzymes [UGT1A1](/wiki/UGT1A1) and [UGT2B7](/wiki/UGT2B7).[[4]](#cite_note-pmid27105861-4) It shows very minimal [metabolism](/wiki/Metabolism) by cytochrome P50 enzymes, with CYP3A4 merely responsible for the greatest degree of metabolism.[[4]](#cite_note-pmid27105861-4) Since enobosarm is metabolized by CYP3A4, UGT1A1, and UGT2B7, [inhibitors](/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor) and [inducers](/wiki/Enzyme_inducer) of these enzymes can modify the metabolism and [pharmacokinetics](/wiki/Pharmacokinetics) of enobosarm.[[4]](#cite_note-pmid27105861-4) The strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [itraconazole](/wiki/Itraconazole) was shown to have minimal to no influence on the pharmacokinetics of enobosarm, whereas the strong CYP3A4 inducer [rifampin](/wiki/Rifampin) reduced enobosarm [peak](/wiki/Cmax_(pharmacology)) levels by 23%, [elimination half-life](/wiki/Elimination_half-life) by 23%, and [area-under-the-curve levels](/wiki/Area-under-the-curve_levels) by 43%.[[46]](#cite_note-pmid27885819-46)[[4]](#cite_note-pmid27105861-4) The pan-UGT inhibitor [probenecid](/wiki/Probenecid) was shown to not affect peak levels of enobosarm but to increase the elimination half-life of enobosarm by 78% and to increase area-under-the-curve levels of enobosarm by 50%.[[46]](#cite_note-pmid27885819-46)[[4]](#cite_note-pmid27105861-4) Enobosarm had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of [celecoxib](/wiki/Celecoxib) (a [CYP2C9](/wiki/CYP2C9) substrate) or [rosuvastatin](/wiki/Rosuvastatin) (a [BCRP](/wiki/Breast_cancer_resistance_protein)

interactions](/wiki/Drug_interaction).[[4]](#cite_note-pmid27105861-4)\n\nEnobosarm is a [selective androgen receptor modulator](/wiki/Selective_androgen_receptor_modulator) (SARM), or a [tissue-selective](/wiki/Tissue_selectivity) mixed [agonist](/wiki/Agonist) or [partial agonist](/wiki/Partial_agonist) of the [androgen receptor](/wiki/Androgen_receptor)

DHT.[[47]](#cite_note-pmid23231475-47)[[48]](#cite_note-pmid15987833-48)[[49]](#cite_note-pmid20444881-49) Enobosarm shows [enantioselectivity](/wiki/Enantioselectivity) for the AR and has similar but somewhat lower [potency](/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)) than DHT in terms of activating the receptor.[[7]](#cite_note-JonesCossSteinerDalton2013-7) In addition to general activation of the AR, enobosarm induces the N/C interaction (the interaction of the [amino terminus](/wiki/Amino_terminus) and [carboxyl terminus](/wiki/Carboxyl_terminus)) of the AR less potently than does DHT, but in any case promotes the N/C interaction concentration-dependently and to the same maximal extent as DHT.[[49]](#cite_note-pmid20444881-49) The AR is widely expressed in [tissues](/wiki/Tissue_(biology))

characterized.[[18]](#cite_note-MohlerNair2005-18)[[20]](#cite_note-pmid25905231-20) In any case, enobosarm has been demonstrated to have varying [full agonist](/wiki/Full_agonist) or [partial agonist](/wiki/Partial_agonist) or [antagonist](/wiki/Receptor_antagonist) actions in specific tissues, including [potent](/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)) agonistic and [anabolic](/wiki/Anabolic) effects in [muscle](/wiki/Muscle) and [bone](/wiki/Bone), potent agonistic effects in AR-expressing human [breast cancer](/wiki/Breast_cancer) [cell lines](/wiki/Cell_line) like [MCF-7](/wiki/MCF-7) and [MDA-MB-231](/wiki/MDA-MB-231),[[19]](#cite_note-pmid25722318-19)[[2]](#cite_note-pmid32257854-2) and partially agonistic or antagonistic effects in the [prostate gland](/wiki/Prostate_gland),

Enobosarm has additionally been shown to stimulate [sexual motivation](/wiki/Sexual_motivation) in female rats similarly to testosterone.[[47]](#cite_note-pmid23231475-47)[[49]](#cite_note-pmid20444881-49) Although enobosarm has not been specifically assessed in this area, another structurally unrelated [quinolinone](/wiki/2-Quinolone) SARM, [LGD-2226](/wiki/LGD-2226), has shown [prosexual](/wiki/Prosexual) effects in male rats comparable to those of the synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid [fluoxymesterone](/wiki/Fluoxymesterone) as well.[[2]](#cite_note-pmid32257854-2)[[47]](#cite_note-pmid23231475-47)[[50]](#cite_note-pmid17023534-50)\nThe [molecular mechanisms](/wiki/Mechanism_of_action) underlying the tissue-selective effects of enobosarm and other SARMs compared to testosterone and other androgens and anabolic steroids remain unknown.[[51]](#cite_note-pmid28624515-51)[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17) However, recruitment of both [coactivators](/wiki/Coactivator_(genetics)) and [corepressors](/wiki/Corepressor) instead of only coactivators and resultant differing [receptor conformations](/wiki/Protein_conformation), distinct tissue-specific modulation of [signaling pathways](/wiki/Signaling_cascade) mediating [genomic](/wiki/Nuclear_receptor) and [non-genomic](/wiki/Membrane_steroid_receptor) effects, and differences in within-tissue [ligand](/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)) [metabolism](/wiki/Metabolism) and modulation of ligand [potency](/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)) (i.e., potentiation versus lack thereof), among others, all constitute possible mechanisms.[[51]](#cite_note-pmid28624515-51)[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[52]](#cite_note-pmid17339601-52) In terms of [coregulator](/wiki/Transcription_coregulator) recruitment, the ratios of coactivators to corepressors vary in different tissues throughout the body, and it is thought that SARMs may have agonistic effects in tissues with an excess of coactivators relative to corepressors like muscle and bone and may have partially agonistic or antagonistic effects in tissues with an excess of corepressors over coactivators like the prostate.[[51]](#cite_note-pmid28624515-51) Another mechanism may be that SARMs like enobosarm induce the N/C interaction less readily than AR full agonists like DHT.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[47]](#cite_note-pmid23231475-47)[[53]](#cite_note-pmid19357508-53)[[49]](#cite_note-pmid20444881-49) Induction of the N/C interaction has been associated with the effects of [endogenous](/wiki/Endogenous) and [exogenous](/wiki/Exogenous) AR agonists, for instance [virilization](/wiki/Virilization) and prostate growth.[[47]](#cite_note-pmid23231475-47)[[49]](#cite_note-pmid20444881-49)[[54]](#cite_note-HohlMarcelli2023-54)[[55]](#cite_note-pmid12051960-55)\nIn [animal studies](/wiki/Animal_studies), enobosarm has shown potent muscle-promoting effects that were similar to those of [testosterone](/wiki/Testosterone_(medication)) and DHT.[[7]](#cite_note-JonesCossSteinerDalton2013-7)[[10]](#cite_note-pmid32476495-10)[[56]](#cite_note-pmid24189892-56)[[57]](#cite_note-pmid26393303-57)[[58]](#cite_note-pmid18801930-58)[[48]](#cite_note-pmid15987833-48) In one of the first published studies, enobosarm maximally restored prostate weight to 51%, seminal vesicle weight to 98%, and levator ani muscle weight to 136% in castrated male rats relative to gonadally intact control male rats, with an [ED50](/wiki/Effective_dose_(pharmacology)) dose for muscle of 0.03&#160;mg/day.[[56]](#cite_note-pmid24189892-56)[[51]](#cite_note-pmid28624515-51)[[48]](#cite_note-pmid15987833-48) For comparison, [testosterone propionate](/wiki/Testosterone_propionate) was able to maximally stimulate levator ani muscle to 104% and prostate weight to 121%, with ED50 doses of 0.15&#160;mg/day and 0.13&#160;mg/day, respectively.[[7]](#cite_note-JonesCossSteinerDalton2013-7) Hence, enobosarm was able to stimulate the levator ani muscle to a size greater than that in normal male rats or produced with exogenous testosterone in castrated male rats, but was only capable of partially rescuing prostate gland weight.[[51]](#cite_note-pmid28624515-51)[[48]](#cite_note-pmid15987833-48)[[7]](#cite_note-JonesCossSteinerDalton2013-7) Additionally, enobosarm fully maintained or restored levator ani weight at doses that did not affect LH or FSH levels in gonadally intact animals (≤0.1&#160;mg/day).[[7]](#cite_note-JonesCossSteinerDalton2013-7) As such, it was more potent in stimulating muscle than testosterone at doses that did not affect [gonadotropin](/wiki/Gonadotropin) levels.[[5]](#cite_note-pmid24490605-5)[[7]](#cite_note-JonesCossSteinerDalton2013-7) In gonadally intact male rats, enobosarm significantly increased levator ani muscle weight to 131% of intact controls but significantly decreased the weights of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles, demonstrating an antagonistic or partially agonistic effect in these tissues.[[7]](#cite_note-JonesCossSteinerDalton2013-7) In another animal study, enobosarm and DHT increased levator ani weights to similar or slightly different extents in intact male rats, but DHT strongly increased prostate weight while enobosarm reduced prostate weight.[[7]](#cite_note-JonesCossSteinerDalton2013-7)[[59]](#cite_note-pmid35063736-59)[[58]](#cite_note-pmid18801930-58) Aside from effects in muscle tissue, enobosarm has been assessed and found to completely maintain bone quality and composition in castrated male rats and to partially but not fully prevent bone loss in ovariectomized female rats, indicating potent anabolic effects in bone as well.[[7]](#cite_note-JonesCossSteinerDalton2013-7)\nIn a [phase 2](/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_II) human clinical trial in healthy elderly men and postmenopausal women, enobosarm dose-dependently increased [lean body mass](/wiki/Lean_body_mass) (muscle mass) across doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3&#160;mg/day, with a significant 1.3&#160;kg gain over placebo at 3&#160;mg/day and a non-significant 0.7&#160;kg gain over placebo at 1&#160;mg/day.[[10]](#cite_note-pmid32476495-10)[[28]](#cite_note-pmid22031847-28) Similarly, in two [phase 3](/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_III) clinical trials in men and postmenopausal women with muscle wasting due to [non-small-cell lung cancer](/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_cancer), enobosarm at 3&#160;mg/day significantly increased lean body mass by 0.41&#160;kg and 0.47&#160;kg.[[10]](#cite_note-pmid32476495-10) However, enobosarm did not successfully increase muscle strength in these phase 3 trials.[[10]](#cite_note-pmid32476495-10) In any case, it has been suggested that the [study designs](/wiki/Clinical_study_design) and physical function outcomes in such trials may have been flawed.[[60]](#cite_note-pmid28807233-60)[[61]](#cite_note-pmid33759397-61)[[62]](#cite_note-pmid30138131-62)[[63]](#cite_note-pmid36866171-63)[[2]](#cite_note-pmid32257854-2) The increases in lean body mass that have been seen with employed doses of enobosarm in clinical trials are very modest compared to those produced with supraphysiological doses of testosterone over similar timeframes (e.g., 0.5–1.5&#160;kg with enobosarm versus 5–8&#160;kg with 300–600&#160;mg/week intramuscular testosterone enanthate in healthy young men).[[53]](#cite_note-pmid19357508-53)[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[64]](#cite_note-pmid11701431-64) The effects of higher doses of enobosarm (9–18&#160;mg/day) on lean body mass and muscle strength are also being evaluated in women with breast cancer.[[2]](#cite_note-pmid32257854-2)[[43]](#cite_note-KassemShohdy2019-43) There is some evidence that women may be more sensitive to lean body mass increases with SARMs, specifically [GSK-2881078](/wiki/GSK2881078) but potentially also others like enobosarm, than men.[[10]](#cite_note-pmid32476495-10)[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)\nIn addition to its mixed agonist–antagonist activity at the AR, enobosarm is likely to also differ from steroidal androgens in its effects due to differences in within-tissue ligand metabolism.[[37]](#cite_note-pmid18500378-37)[[31]](#cite_note-pmid24945109-31)[[18]](#cite_note-MohlerNair2005-18)[[52]](#cite_note-pmid17339601-52) The [virilizing](/wiki/Virilization) and androgenic effects of the traditional steroidal androgens like testosterone in [skin](/wiki/Skin), [hair follicles](/wiki/Hair_follicle), and the [prostate gland](/wiki/Prostate_gland) are attributed to high [expression](/wiki/Gene_expression) of [5α-reductase](/wiki/5%CE%B1-reductase) in these tissues and consequent local conversion and potentiation into more [potent](/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)) androgens.[[37]](#cite_note-pmid18500378-37)[[31]](#cite_note-pmid24945109-31)[[18]](#cite_note-MohlerNair2005-18) In the case of testosterone, this is via conversion into the 10-fold more potent androgen DHT.[[31]](#cite_note-pmid24945109-31)[[18]](#cite_note-MohlerNair2005-18) Enobosarm is not subject to this local transformation and potentiation, and so is theorized to have greatly reduced effects in these tissues relative to testosterone and certain other steroidal androgens.[[31]](#cite_note-pmid24945109-31)[[18]](#cite_note-MohlerNair2005-18)[[20]](#cite_note-pmid25905231-20) This is likewise theorized to be the case for non-5α-reductase-potentiated anabolic steroids like nandrolone and oxandrolone, which have high [myotrophic–androgenic potency ratios](/wiki/Anabolic_steroid#Pharmacology) in animals.[[37]](#cite_note-pmid18500378-37) The lack of 5α-reduction may result in reduced androgenic side effects like [scalp hair loss](/wiki/Scalp_hair_loss), [facial and body hair growth](/wiki/Hirsutism), and [prostate growth](/wiki/Prostatism).[[20]](#cite_note-pmid25905231-20)[[65]](#cite_note-pmid27141449-65)[[11]](#cite_note-pmid27535042-11) On the other hand, although SARMs, like enobosarm, as well as anabolic steroids, may have reduced virilizing effects in skin and hair follicles, this is not necessarily the case for virilization in general.[[37]](#cite_note-pmid18500378-37)[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17) In particular, the muscle-promoting effects of these agents can be considered a masculinizing effect.[[16]](#cite_note-pmid26401842-16)[[66]](#cite_note-pmid36644692-66) The potential masculinizing effects of enobosarm and SARMs in general are largely uncharacterized and unknown.[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17) Aside from metabolism differences related to 5α-reduction, enobosarm has also shown much greater impact in the [liver](/wiki/Liver), specifically on certain aspects of [hepatic protein synthesis](/wiki/Liver_protein_synthesis) like reduction of [sex hormone-binding globulin](/wiki/Sex_hormone-binding_globulin) (SHBG) production, than even highly [supraphysiological](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/supraphysiological) doses of [parenteral](/wiki/Parenteral_administration) [testosterone](/wiki/Testosterone_(medication)).[[28]](#cite_note-pmid22031847-28) This phenomenon has also been seen with other SARMs, such as [LGD-4033](/wiki/LGD-4033),[[17]](#cite_note-pmid33148520-17)[[32]](#cite_note-pmid37218811-32)[[16]](#cite_note-pmid26401842-16)[[67]](#cite_note-pmid22459616-67) as well as with

through the liver with [oral administration](/wiki/Oral_administration) and to the high oral [bioavailability](/wiki/Bioavailability) and strong resistance to hepatic metabolism of these agents.[[20]](#cite_note-pmid25905231-20)[[70]](#cite_note-pmid3320548-70)[[71]](#cite_note-pmid3320549-71)[[12]](#cite_note-pmid36479151-12)\nEnobosarm has no

As a result, the drug is not expected to have [feminizing](/wiki/Feminization_(biology)) effects or risk of [gynecomastia](/wiki/Gynecomastia) (breast development) nor to stimulate estrogen-sensitive breast cancer.[[18]](#cite_note-MohlerNair2005-18)[[7]](#cite_note-JonesCossSteinerDalton2013-7) SARMs like enobosarm are not ideal agents for [androgen replacement therapy](/wiki/Androgen_replacement_therapy) as they are not expected to reproduce the full spectrum of effects of testosterone and other androgens, including not only AR-mediated effects but also notably [aromatization](/wiki/Aromatization) into [estrogen](/wiki/Estrogen) and required physiological [estrogenic](/wiki/Estrogen) effects in [bone](/wiki/Bone) and [brain](/wiki/Brain).[[20]](#cite_note-pmid25905231-20) Enobosarm has been found to be a weak [antagonist](/wiki/Receptor_antagonist) of the [progesterone receptor](/wiki/Progesterone_receptor) and

Unfortunately, results of recent clinical trials of the SARM GTx-024 (Enobosarm) have tempered expectations for its utility as a therapy for muscle wasting. Early on, GTx-024 appeared to have a very bright future as a treatment for sarcopenia/cachexia. Preliminary clinical trials demonstrated that GTx-024 could increase lean body mass and improve physical function without androgenic side effects (27). However, Enobosarm was dealt a blow after the phase III Prevention and treatment Of muscle Wasting in patients with cancER (POWER) I and II trials, where increases in lean body mass were once again observed, but without improved stair climb power (79,80). Failure to attain both primary endpoints led to a lack of approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has cast doubt on the previously charted course for SARMs and has tempered enthusiasm regarding the role of SARMs in the treatment of muscle wasting conditions.\n\n^ [***a***](#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-1) [***c***](#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-2) [***d***](#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-3) [***e***](#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-4) [***f***](#cite_ref-pmid24074268_3-5) Kim J, Wang R, Veverka KA, Dalton JT (November 2013). \"Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the novel SARM GTx-024 [(S)-N-(4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-3-(4-cyanophenoxy)-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanamide] in rats\". *Xenobiotica; the Fate of Foreign Compounds in Biological Systems*. **43** (11): 993–1009.

[...] to proceed with enobosarm into a phase III clinical trial in patients with sarcopenia, the FDA requested a cardiovascular safety study, which the manufacturer refused to undertake due to considerable costs and decided to test enobosarm in cancer cachexia patients in whom the FDA was more tolerant to the long-term cardiovascular side effects [67]. [...] Enobosarm promotes a similar anabolic response compared with DHT via muscle AR activation, [...] [35]. In a recent study with ovariectomized mice, the weight of the musculus gastrocnemius has been shown to be higher in all groups treated with ostarine as well as bone mineral density and bone biomechanical properties [15]. Moreover, the stimulation of reproductive organs with enobosarm seems to be less pronounced compared to testosterone administration [36] due to its partial agonist and antagonist effect on other androgen-dependent tissues such as prostate and seminal vesicles [37]. [...] In the POWER trials (POWER 1, NCT01355484 and POWER 2, NCT01355497; Table 1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, and multi-center phase III studies [40], patients with non-small-cell lung cancer were given 3 mg of enobosarm or placebo for five months.

However, reduced liver clearance increases the potential for hepatotoxicity.19 Much like this class of AASs, SARMs have been designed for adequate oral bioavailability with decreased liver degradation which would likely create a similar potential for hepatotoxicity.8,15 [...] Ostarine was the first SARM to undergo a phase III clinical trial.

Anabolic androgenic steroids (AASs) comprise synthetic derivatives of testosterone. AASs bind directly to the cytosolic androgen receptor (AR), which is widely distributed across reproductive and non-reproductive tissues, including the prostate, skeletal muscle, liver, skin, and central nervous system (CNS). This binding results in various physiological activities [1], the major one being a masculinizing effect in the skeletal muscle via muscle building [2].\n\n^ [***a***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-1) [***c***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-2) [***d***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-3) [***e***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-4) [***f***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-5) [***g***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-6) [***h***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-7) [***i***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-8) [***j***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-9) [***k***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-10) [***l***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-11) [***m***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-12) [***n***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-13) [***o***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-14) [***p***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-15) [***q***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-16) [***r***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-17) [***s***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-18) [***t***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-19) [***u***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-20) [***v***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-21) [***w***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-22) [***x***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-23) [***y***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-24) [***z***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-25) [***aa***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-26) [***ab***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-27) [***ac***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-28) [***ad***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-29) [***ae***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-30) [***af***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-31) [***ag***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-32) [***ah***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-33) [***ai***](#cite_ref-pmid33148520_17-34) Machek SB, Cardaci TD, Wilburn DT, Willoughby DS (December 2020). \"Considerations, possible contraindications, and potential mechanisms for deleterious effect in recreational and athletic use of selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) in lieu of anabolic androgenic steroids: A narrative review\". *Steroids*. **164** 108753.

Selective AR modulators (SARMs) are a class of drugs in development; unlike androgen synthesis inhibitors, they act as selective androgen agonists and show promise as a potential therapeutic strategy in BCa. Enobosarm (GTx024) is the farthest along in clinical development, and demonstrates an agonist effect that in some populations inhibits BCa growth. Preclinical data show antitumor activity of GTx-024 in ARC stably expressing cell lines MCF-7 (ERC) and MDA-MB-231 (TNBC) implanted subcutaneously into nude mice. Tumor growth was reduced more than 75% in MDA-MB-231-AR cells and 50% in MCF-7-AR cells compared with vehicle-treated tumors, demonstrating benefit (Dalton et al. 2013).\n\n^ [***a***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-1) [***c***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-2) [***d***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-3) [***e***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-4) [***f***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-5) [***g***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-6) [***h***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-7) [***i***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-8) [***j***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-9) [***k***](#cite_ref-pmid25905231_20-10) Feingold KR, Anawalt B, Blackman MR, Boyce A, Chrousos G, Corpas E, et&#160;al.

[111] in 1998, six decades after the first non-steroidal estrogen [112]. This creates a new class of non-steroidal synthetic androgen, often termed Specific Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARM), a misleading marketing term rather than an accurate pharmacological description [113,114], usurping a speculative but unsound analogy with Specific Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERM). [...] none of the non-steroidal androgens under development [116,117] are marketed by 2021. Yet hope springs eternal for this new attempt to separate anabolic from androgenic properties of androgens to facilitate marketing for muscle wasting and other selective effects of testosterone.\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-pmid21511988_40-0)** Handelsman DJ (May 2011). \"Commentary: androgens and \"anabolic steroids\": the one-headed janus\". *Endocrinology*. **152** (5): 1752–1754.

Although development of the first nonsteroidal androgens (17, 18) as candidate selective AR modulators (19) raises hope of resurrecting this defunct term (20), prereceptor activation mechanisms cannot apply to nonsteroidal androgens, and the singular AR lacks a dual drive mechanism of the other paired sex steroid receptors. Consequently, it is not surprising that available knowledge (21) provides only slender hope that this failed, and probably false, dichotomy will now succeed through a renewed search guided by the same in vivo bioassay.\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-FDA2017_41-0)** [\"FDA In Brief: FDA warns against using SARMs in body-building products\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20190803085240/https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-brief/fda-brief-fda-warns-against-using-sarms-body-building-products).

It is worth noting that SARMs were initially developed to get benefit of their anabolic effect on muscle and bone without much harm to other tissues. One randomized controlled trial [28], recruited male and females with cancer and weight loss showed that enobosarm 1 mg or 3 mg was associated with significant increase in lean body mass compared to placebo. This led to another ongoing trial, with more selection, aiming to evaluate enobosarm (with higher doses 9 or 18 mg) effect on physical function and lean body mass of ER+/AR+ breast cancer patients (NCT02463032). Such additional action of this class of drugs carries major hope for patients with AR-positive advanced breast cancer, where weight loss, muscle weakness and physical inactivity represent a big challenge for the patient's quality of life (QOL).\n\n^ [***a***](#cite_ref-pmid37946721_44-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-pmid37946721_44-1) [***c***](#cite_ref-pmid37946721_44-2) Hackbart H, Cui X, Lee JS (October 2023).

That N/C interaction is essential in AR physiology is demonstrated by the identification of AR LBD mutations resulting in androgen insensitivity syndromes (AIS) that disrupt N/C interaction without affecting the equilibrium binding affinity for the ligand [119, 120].\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-pmid12051960_55-0)** He B, Wilson EM (April 2002). \"The NH(2)-terminal and carboxyl-terminal interaction in the human androgen receptor\". *Mol Genet Metab*. **75** (4): 293–8.

Enobosarm was discovered in 2004 as a hyper-myoanabolic SARM that dissociated the anabolic from androgenic effects of AR in terms of potency (ED50) and efficacy (Emax) [29]. Levator ani muscle weight was increased to 131 and 136% of intact controls in intact and castrated (maintenance mode) rats, respectively, without significant increases in ventral prostate and seminal vesicles weights. Importantly, increases in levator ani muscle weight were associated with increases in muscle strength (soleus) in rats. Enobosarm also exerted in-vivo osteoanabolic effects alone and synergistically with alendronate in terms of bone density, strength, and structure [30], which was explained by in-vitro mechanistic studies that demonstrated antiresorptive (osteoclast inhibition) and anabolic (osteoblast differentiation) effects [31].\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-pmid26393303_57-0)** Dubois V, Simitsidellis I, Laurent MR, Jardi F, Saunders PT, Vanderschueren D, et&#160;al.

[...] these compounds have several properties in common: they are small, very lipophilic molecules with the potential to freely diffuse through cell membranes. Their receptors also share important features: in all animals, the receptors for steroid hormones are part of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-triggered transcription factors (Mangelsdorf et al. 1995).

Intracellular receptors account for 10% to 15% of drugs on the market, including drugs that act on cytoplasmic receptors such as androgen receptors (ARs), estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and glucocorticoid receptors, and other drugs that act on nuclear receptors such as vitamin D receptor (VDR), thyroid hormone receptors, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors [27-30]. Ligands of intracellular receptors include lipophilic vitamins, steroid hormones, and small chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide, which require membrane permeability for intracellular delivery [30,31]. There are several barriers to the intracellular delivery of therapeutic drugs, such as lysosome degradation and active efflux out of the cell. Lowmolecular-weight lipophilic compounds can diffuse directly into cells, whereas high-molecular-weight compounds usually need membrane transporters or endocytosis [32,33]. Proper entry into the cell and subsequent contact with the exact target lead to better therapeutic effects and reduce undesirable adverse effects [34].\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-pmid23881885_76-0)** Mohd Fauzi F, Koutsoukas A, Cunningham A, Gallegos A, Sedefov R, Bender A (July 2013). \"Computer-aided (in silico) approaches in the mode-of-action analysis and safety assessment of ostarine and 4-methylamphetamine\". *Human Psychopharmacology*. **28** (4): 365–378.

          "abstract": "From medicine to sport, selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) have represented promising applications. The ability of SARMs to selectively interact with the androgen receptor (AR) indicates that this kind of molecule can interfere with numerous physiological and pathological processes controlled by the AR regulatory mechanism. However, critical concerns in relation to safety and potential side effects of SARMs remain under discussion and investigation. SARMs, being hydrophobic/organic compounds, can be subjected to hydrophobic interactions. In this perspective, we hypothesize that SARMs interact with lipid membranes, producing significant physical and chemical changes that could be associated with several effects that SARMs represent in biological systems. In this context, the effect of SARMs on lipid membranes mediated by non-specific interactions is little explored. Here, we report significant information related to the changes that ostarine, ligandrol, andarine, and cardarine produce in the thermodynamic properties of a lipid biomembrane model. Physical changes and chemical interactions of the systems were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), and theoretical calculations implementing density functional theory (DFT). We demonstrate that ostarine, ligandrol, andarine, and cardarine can strongly interact with a lipid biomembrane model composed of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), and accordingly, these molecules can be incorporated into the polar/hydrophobic regions of the lipid bilayer. By employing theoretical calculations, we gained insights into the possible electrostatic interactions between SARMs and phospholipid molecules, enhancing our understanding of the driving forces behind the interactions of SARMs with lipid membranes. Overall, this investigation provides relevant knowledge related to the biophysical-chemical effects that SARMs produce in biomembrane models and could be of practical reference for promising applications of SARMs in medicine and sport.",

Development of andarine for all indications has been discontinued, in favor of the structurally related and improved compound enobosarm (ostarine; GTx-024; S-22). </p><p>Andarine is an orally active partial agonist of the androgen receptor (AR). In intact male rats, 0.5 mg andarine daily was shown to reduce prostate weight to 79.4%, and non-significantly increased levator ani muscle weight. In castrated male rats, this dose restored only 32.5% prostate weight, but 101% levator ani muscle weight This suggests that andarine is able to competitively block binding of dihydrotestosterone to its receptor targets in the prostate gland, but its partial agonist actions at the androgen receptor prevent the side effects associated with the antiandrogens traditionally used for treatment of BPH. </p><p>Andarine was first described in the literature by 2002. It completed phase 1 clinical trials for cachexia in 2003. Three phase 1 trials (1a, 1b, 1c) were completed with the drug involving 86 healthy male and female volunteers. Phase 2 trials were planned for 2004. However, development of andarine was discontinued, reportedly due to findings of visual disturbances in clinical studies. Andarine is thought to have been the first SARM to enter human clinical trials. </p> <ul><li>Acetothiolutamide</li> <li>GTx-027</li></ul> <div><ol> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-ReferenceA_1-0\">^</a></b> <cite >Yin D, Gao W, Kearbey JD, Xu H, Chung K, He Y, et&#160;al.

We tested Andarine for safety and tolerance in single and multiple doses. Results from our Phase I trials support once-a-day oral dosing, and no serious adverse events were observed at any single or multiple dose tested. We observed early indications in the multiple-dose Phase I clinical trial in men that Andarine promoted growth activity, as measured by levels of a growth factor in the blood known as IGF-1, without affecting the sebaceous glands.

In intact male rats, 0.5 mg andarine daily was shown to reduce prostate weight to 79.4%, and non-significantly increased [levator ani](/wiki/Levator_ani) muscle weight. In castrated male rats, this dose restored only 32.5% prostate weight, but 101%  levator ani muscle weight [[4]](#cite_note-4) This suggests that andarine is able to competitively block binding of [dihydrotestosterone](/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone) to its receptor targets in the prostate gland, but its partial agonist actions at the androgen receptor  prevent the side effects associated with the antiandrogens traditionally used for treatment of BPH.[[5]](#cite_note-5)\nAndarine was first described in the literature by 2002.[[6]](#cite_note-pmid12161060-6)[[7]](#cite_note-pmid12604714-7)[[8]](#cite_note-Perera2003-8) It completed [phase 1](/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_I) [clinical trials](/wiki/Clinical_trial) for [cachexia](/wiki/Cachexia) in 2003.[[9]](#cite_note-pmid19432422-9)[[10]](#cite_note-SEC2023-10) Three phase 1 trials (1a, 1b, 1c) were completed with the drug involving 86 healthy male and female volunteers.[[10]](#cite_note-SEC2023-10) [Phase 2](/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_II) trials were planned for 2004.[[10]](#cite_note-SEC2023-10) However, development of andarine was discontinued, reportedly due to findings of [visual disturbances](/wiki/Visual_disturbances) in clinical studies.[[3]](#cite_note-AdisInsight-3)[[11]](#cite_note-pmid23427117-11) Andarine is thought to have been the first SARM to enter human clinical trials.[[12]](#cite_note-Oncternal2004-12)\n\n- [Acetothiolutamide](/wiki/Acetothiolutamide)\n\n- [GTx-027](/wiki/GTx-027)\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-ReferenceA_1-0)** Yin D, Gao W, Kearbey JD, Xu H, Chung K, He Y, et&#160;al.

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 22 December 2003. Clinical Trials. We have completed three Phase I clinical trials of Andarine in a total of 86 healthy male and female volunteers. We tested Andarine for safety and tolerance in single and multiple doses. Results from our Phase I trials support once-a-day oral dosing, and no serious adverse events were observed at any single or multiple dose tested. We observed early indications in the multiple-dose Phase I clinical trial in men that Andarine promoted growth activity, as measured by levels of a growth factor in the blood known as IGF-1, without affecting the sebaceous glands. We believe that these observations support the potential ability of Andarine to selectively modulate androgen receptors in a tissue-specific manner.\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-pmid23427117_11-0)** Starcevic B, Ahrens BD, Butch AW (May 2013). \"Detection of the selective androgen receptor modulator S-4 (Andarine) in a doping control sample\". *Drug Testing and Analysis*. **5** (5): 377–379.

</td></tr> </tbody></table> <p><b>Higenamine</b> (<b>norcoclaurine</b>) is a chemical compound found in a variety of plants including <i>Nandina domestica</i> (fruit), <i>Aconitum carmichaelii</i> (root), <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Asarum_heterotropioides&action=edit&redlink=1\" title=\"Asarum heterotropioides (page does not exist)\">Asarum heterotropioides</a></i>, <i>Galium divaricatum</i> (stem and vine), <i>Annona squamosa</i>, and <i>Nelumbo nucifera</i> (lotus seeds). </p><p>Higenamine is found as an ingredient in sports and weight loss dietary supplements sold in the US. The US Food and Drug Administration has received reports of adverse effects from higenamine-containing supplements since 2014, but higenamine's health risks remain poorly understood. </p> <meta property=\"mw:PageProp/toc\"> <p>Higenamine, also known as norcoclaurine HCl, is legal to use within food supplements in the UK, EU, the USA and Canada. Its main use is within food supplements developed for weight management and sports supplements. Traditional formulations with higenamine have been used for thousands of years within Chinese medicine and come from a variety of sources including fruit and orchids. There are no studies comparing the safety of modern formulations (based on synthetic higenamine) with traditional formulations. Nevertheless, it will not be added to the EU 'novel foods' catalogue, which details all food supplements that require a safety assessment certificate before use. </p><p>Along with many other <a href=\"/wiki/Beta2-adrenergic_agonist\" title=\"Beta2-adrenergic agonist\">β<sub>2</sub> agonists</a>, higenamine is prohibited by World Anti-Doping Agency for use in sports. In 2016, French footballer Mamadou Sakho was temporarily banned by UEFA after testing positive for Higenamine causing the player to miss the 2016 Europa League final. The ban was lifted after the player successfully made the mitigating defence that there was an absence of significant negligence as the substance was not on the list of banned substances despite drugs of the same category – β<sub>2</sub> agonists – being banned. </p> <p>Since higenamine is present in plants which have a history of use in traditional medicine, the pharmacology of this compound has attracted scientific interest. </p><p>In animal models, higenamine has been demonstrated to be a <a href=\"/wiki/Beta2-adrenergic_agonist\" title=\"Beta2-adrenergic agonist\">β<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptor agonist</a>. Adrenergic receptors, or adrenoceptors, belong to the class of G protein–coupled receptors, and are the most prominent receptors in the adipose membrane, besides also being expressed in skeletal muscle tissue. These adipose membrane receptors are classified as either α or β adrenoceptors. Although these adrenoceptors share the same messenger, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), the specific transduction pathway depends on the receptor type (α or β). Higenamine partly exerts its actions by the activation of an enzyme, adenylate cyclase, responsible for boosting the cellular concentrations of the adrenergic second messenger, cAMP. </p><p>In a rodent model, it was found that higenamine produced cardiotonic, vascular relaxation, and bronchodilator effects. In particular, higenamine, via a beta-adrenoceptor mechanism, induced relaxation in rat corpus cavernosum, leading to improved vasodilation and erectile function. </p><p>Related to improved vasodilatory signals, higenamine has been shown in animal models to possess antiplatelet and antithrombotic activity via a cAMP-dependent pathway, suggesting higenamine may contribute to enhanced vasodilation and arterial integrity. </p><p>In humans, higenamine has been studied as an investigational drug in China for use as a pharmacological agent for cardiac stress tests as well as for treatment of a number of cardiac conditions including bradyarrhythmias. The human trials were relatively small (ranging from 10 to 120 subjects) and higenamine was administered intravenously, most commonly using gradual infusions of 2.5 or 5&#160;mg. Higenamine consistently increased heart rate but had variable effects on blood pressure. One small study described higenamine's effect on cardiac output: higenamine led to an increased ejection fraction in 15 patients with heart disease. </p> <p>The safety of orally administered higenamine in humans is unknown. During a study of acute toxicity, mice were orally administered the compound at a dose of 2 g per kg of bodyweight. No mice died during the study. In human trials of intravenous higenamine, subjects who received higenamine reported shortness of breath, racing heart, dizziness, headaches, chest tightness. </p> <p>(S)-Norcoclaurine/Higenamine is at the center of benzylisoquinoline alkaloid (BIA) biosynthesis. In spite of large structure diversity, BIAs biosynthesis all share a common first committed intermediate (S)-norcoclaurine. (S)-norcoclaurine is produced by the condensation of two tyrosine derivatives, dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (4-HPAA). </p> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:(S)-Norcoclaurine_Biosynthesis.tif\"><img alt=\"Synthesis of the two substrates: dopamine and 4-HPAA\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/%28S%29-Norcoclaurine_Biosynthesis.tif/lossless-page1-496px-%28S%29-Norcoclaurine_Biosynthesis.tif.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"496\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/%28S%29-Norcoclaurine_Biosynthesis.tif/lossless-page1-744px-%28S%29-Norcoclaurine_Biosynthesis.tif.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/%28S%29-Norcoclaurine_Biosynthesis.tif/lossless-page1-992px-%28S%29-Norcoclaurine_Biosynthesis.tif.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"3015\" data-file-height=\"2130\"></a><figcaption>Synthesis of the two substrates: dopamine and 4-HPAA</figcaption></figure> <p>In plants, tyrosine is synthesized through Shikimate pathway, during which the last step involves decarboxylation and dehydrogenation of arogenate to give L-tyrosine. To generate dopamine from tyrosine, there are two pathways. In one pathway, tyrosine undergoes decarboxylation catalyzed by tyrosine decarboxylase (TyrDC) to become tyramine, which is then followed by oxidation of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) to render dopamine. Alternatively, tyrosine can be oxidized by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) to form L-DOPA, which is then later decarboxylated by DOPA decarboxylase (DDC) to provide dopamine. Besides that, the other starting material, 4-HPAA, is generated through a first transamination by tyrosine transeaminase (TyrAT) to form 4-hydroxylphenylpyruvate (4-HPP), and a subsequent decarboxylation by 4-HPP decarboxylase. </p> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:(S)-Norcoclaurine_Biosynthesis-_the_final_step.tif\"><img alt=\"Synthesis of (S)-Higenamine by NCS and its mechanism.\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/%28S%29-Norcoclaurine_Biosynthesis-_the_final_step.tif/lossless-page1-498px-%28S%29-Norcoclaurine_Biosynthesis-_the_final_step.tif.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"498\" height=\"180\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/%28S%29-Norcoclaurine_Biosynthesis-_the_final_step.tif/lossless-page1-747px-%28S%29-Norcoclaurine_Biosynthesis-_the_final_step.tif.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/%28S%29-Norcoclaurine_Biosynthesis-_the_final_step.tif/lossless-page1-996px-%28S%29-Norcoclaurine_Biosynthesis-_the_final_step.tif.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"3004\" data-file-height=\"1085\"></a><figcaption>Synthesis of (S)-Higenamine by NCS and its mechanism.</figcaption></figure> <p>The condensation of dopamine and 4-HPAA to form (S)-norcoclaurine is catalyzed by (S)-norcoclaurine synthase (NCS).

references](/wiki/Wikipedia:Chemical_infobox#References)\n\n**Higenamine** (**norcoclaurine**) is a chemical compound found in a variety of plants including *[Nandina domestica](/wiki/Nandina_domestica)* (fruit), *[Aconitum carmichaelii](/wiki/Aconitum_carmichaelii)* (root),  *[Asarum heterotropioides](/w/index.php?title=Asarum_heterotropioides&action=edit&redlink=1)*, *[Galium divaricatum](/wiki/Galium_divaricatum)* (stem and vine), *[Annona squamosa](/wiki/Annona_squamosa)*, and *[Nelumbo nucifera](/wiki/Nelumbo_nucifera)* (lotus seeds).\nHigenamine is found as an ingredient in sports and weight loss dietary supplements sold in the US.[[1]](#cite_note-Clin_Tox-1) The US Food and Drug Administration has received reports of adverse effects from higenamine-containing supplements since 2014, but higenamine's health risks remain poorly understood.[[1]](#cite_note-Clin_Tox-1)\n\nHigenamine, also known as norcoclaurine [HCl](/wiki/Hydrochloride), is legal to use within food supplements in the [UK](/wiki/United_Kingdom), [EU](/wiki/European_Union), the [USA](/wiki/United_States) and [Canada](/wiki/Canada). Its main use is within food supplements developed for weight management and sports supplements.[[1]](#cite_note-Clin_Tox-1)  Traditional formulations with higenamine have been used for thousands of years within Chinese medicine and come from a variety of sources including fruit and orchids. There are no studies comparing the safety of modern formulations (based on synthetic higenamine) with traditional formulations. Nevertheless, it will not be added to the EU 'novel foods' catalogue, which details all food supplements that require a safety assessment certificate before use.[[2]](#cite_note-2)\nAlong with many other [β2 agonists](/wiki/Beta2-adrenergic_agonist), higenamine is prohibited by [World Anti-Doping Agency](/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency) for use in sports.[[3]](#cite_note-3) In 2016, French footballer [Mamadou Sakho](/wiki/Mamadou_Sakho) was temporarily banned by UEFA after testing positive for Higenamine causing the player to miss the 2016 Europa League final. The ban was lifted after the player successfully made the mitigating defence that there was an absence of significant negligence as the substance was not on the list of banned substances despite drugs of the same category – β2 agonists – being banned.[[4]](#cite_note-4)[[5]](#cite_note-5)[[6]](#cite_note-6)[[7]](#cite_note-7)\n\nSince higenamine is present in plants which have a history of use in [traditional medicine](/wiki/Traditional_medicine), the pharmacology of this compound has attracted scientific interest.\nIn animal models, higenamine has been demonstrated to be a [β2 adrenoreceptor agonist](/wiki/Beta2-adrenergic_agonist).[[8]](#cite_note-Tsukiyama-8)[[9]](#cite_note-Kashiwada-9)[[10]](#cite_note-Kimura-10)[[11]](#cite_note-Kang-11)[[12]](#cite_note-Yun-12) Adrenergic receptors, or adrenoceptors, belong to the class of [G protein–coupled receptors](/wiki/G_protein%E2%80%93coupled_receptor), and are the most prominent receptors in the [adipose](/wiki/Adipose_tissue) membrane, besides also being expressed in skeletal muscle tissue. These adipose membrane receptors are classified as either α or β adrenoceptors. Although these adrenoceptors share the same messenger, [cyclic adenosine monophosphate](/wiki/Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate) (cAMP), the specific transduction pathway depends on the receptor type (α or β). Higenamine partly exerts its actions by the activation of an enzyme, [adenylate cyclase](/wiki/Adenylyl_cyclase), responsible for boosting the cellular concentrations of the adrenergic second messenger, cAMP.[[13]](#cite_note-Kam-13)\nIn a rodent model, it was found that higenamine produced [cardiotonic](/wiki/Cardiac_stimulant), vascular relaxation, and [bronchodilator](/wiki/Bronchodilator) effects.[[14]](#cite_note-Bai-14)[[15]](#cite_note-Pyo-15)  In particular, higenamine, via a beta-adrenoceptor mechanism, induced relaxation in rat [corpus cavernosum](/wiki/Corpus_cavernosum_penis), leading to improved [vasodilation](/wiki/Vasodilation) and erectile function.\n\nIn humans, higenamine has been studied as an investigational drug in China for use as a pharmacological agent for cardiac stress tests as well as for treatment of a number of cardiac conditions including bradyarrhythmias.[[1]](#cite_note-Clin_Tox-1)  The human trials were relatively small (ranging from 10 to 120 subjects) and higenamine was administered intravenously, most commonly using gradual infusions of 2.5 or 5&#160;mg.[[1]](#cite_note-Clin_Tox-1) Higenamine consistently increased heart rate but had variable effects on blood pressure. One small study described higenamine's effect on cardiac output: higenamine led to an increased ejection fraction in 15 patients with heart disease.[[1]](#cite_note-Clin_Tox-1)\n\nThe safety of orally administered higenamine in humans is unknown.  During a study of acute toxicity, mice were orally administered the compound at a dose of 2 g per kg of bodyweight. No mice died during the study.[[17]](#cite_note-Lo-17)  In human trials of intravenous higenamine, subjects who received higenamine reported shortness of breath, racing heart, dizziness, headaches, chest tightness.[[1]](#cite_note-Clin_Tox-1)\n\n(S)-Norcoclaurine/Higenamine is at the center of [benzylisoquinoline alkaloid](/wiki/Benzylisoquinoline_alkaloids) (BIA) biosynthesis. In spite of large structure diversity, BIAs biosynthesis all share a common first committed intermediate (S)-norcoclaurine.[[18]](#cite_note-18) (S)-norcoclaurine is produced by the condensation of two tyrosine derivatives, dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (4-HPAA).\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/%28S%29-Norcoclaurine_Biosynthesis.tif/lossless-page1-496px-%28S%29-Norcoclaurine_Biosynthesis.tif.png)](/wiki/File:(S)-Norcoclaurine_Biosynthesis.tif)Synthesis of the two substrates: dopamine and 4-HPAA\nIn plants, tyrosine is synthesized through [Shikimate pathway](/wiki/Shikimate_pathway), during which the last step involves decarboxylation and dehydrogenation of arogenate to give [L-tyrosine](/wiki/Tyrosine). To generate [dopamine](/wiki/Dopamine) from tyrosine, there are two pathways. In one pathway, tyrosine undergoes decarboxylation catalyzed by tyrosine decarboxylase (TyrDC) to become tyramine, which is then followed by oxidation of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) to render dopamine.[[19]](#cite_note-19)[[20]](#cite_note-Beaudoin_2014-20) Alternatively, tyrosine can be oxidized by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) to form [L-DOPA](/wiki/L-DOPA), which is then later decarboxylated by DOPA decarboxylase (DDC) to provide dopamine. Besides that, the other starting material, 4-HPAA, is generated through a first transamination by tyrosine transeaminase (TyrAT) to form 4-hydroxylphenylpyruvate (4-HPP), and a subsequent decarboxylation by 4-HPP decarboxylase.[[20]](#cite_note-Beaudoin_2014-20)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/%28S%29-Norcoclaurine_Biosynthesis-_the_final_step.tif/lossless-page1-498px-%28S%29-Norcoclaurine_Biosynthesis-_the_final_step.tif.png)](/wiki/File:(S)-Norcoclaurine_Biosynthesis-_the_final_step.tif)Synthesis of (S)-Higenamine by NCS and its mechanism.\nThe condensation of dopamine and 4-HPAA to form (S)-norcoclaurine is catalyzed by [(S)-norcoclaurine synthase](/wiki/(S)-norcoclaurine_synthase) (NCS).[[21]](#cite_note-21) Such reaction is one type of [Pictet-Spengler reaction](/wiki/Pictet%E2%80%93Spengler_reaction). In this reaction, Asp-141 and Glu-110 in the NCS active site are involved in the activation of the amine and carbonyl respectively to facilitate imine formation. Then, the molecule will be cyclized as the mechanism shown below to produce (S)-nococlaurine.\n\n- [Papaverine](/wiki/Papaverine)\n\n^ [***a***](#cite_ref-Clin_Tox_1-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-Clin_Tox_1-1) [***c***](#cite_ref-Clin_Tox_1-2) [***d***](#cite_ref-Clin_Tox_1-3) [***e***](#cite_ref-Clin_Tox_1-4) [***f***](#cite_ref-Clin_Tox_1-5) [***g***](#cite_ref-Clin_Tox_1-6) Cohen, Pieter A.; Travis, John C.; Keizers, Peter H.

          "abstract": "The first nootropic prohibited in sport was fonturacetam (4-phenylpiracetam, carphedon) in 1998. Presented here 25&#x2009;years later is a broad-scale consideration of the history, pharmacology, prevalence, regulations, and doping potential of nootropics viewed through a lens of 50 selected dietary supplements (DS) marketed as \"cognitive enhancement,\" \"brain health,\" \"brain boosters,\" or \"nootropics,\" with a focus on unauthorized ingredients. Nootropic DS have risen to prominence over the last decade often as multicomponent formulations of bioactive ingredients presenting compelling pharmacological questions and potential public health concerns. Many popular nootropics are unauthorized food or DS ingredients according to the European Commission including huperzine A, yohimbine, and dimethylaminoethanol; unapproved pharmaceuticals like phenibut or emoxypine (mexidol); previously registered drugs like meclofenoxate or reserpine; EU authorized pharmaceuticals like piracetam or vinpocetine; infamous doping agents like methylhexaneamine or dimethylbutylamine; and other investigational substances and peptides. Several are authorized DS ingredients in the United States resulting in significant global variability as to what qualifies as a legal nootropic. Prohibited stimulants or &#xdf;2-agonists commonly used in \"pre-workout,\" \"weight loss,\" or \"thermogenic\" DS such as octodrine, hordenine, or higenamine are often stacked with nootropic substances. While stimulants and &#xdf;2-agonists are defined as doping agents by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), many nootropics are not, although some may qualify as non-approved substances or related substances under catch-all language in the WADA Prohibited List. Synergistic combinations, excessive dosing, or recently researched pharmacology may justify listing certain nootropics as doping agents or warrant additional attention in future regulations.",

Vincamine is extracted from either the seeds of <i>Voacanga africana</i> or the leaves of <i>Vinca minor</i> (lesser periwinkle). </p> <meta property=\"mw:PageProp/toc\"> <p>Vinpocetine has been used in many Asian and European countries for treatment of cerebrovascular disorders such as stroke and dementia for over three decades. </p><p>The FDA has tentatively ruled that vinpocetine, due to its synthetic nature and proposed therapeutic uses, is ineligible to be marketed as dietary supplement under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Despite this, vinpocetine remains widely available in dietary supplements often marketed as nootropics. </p><p>Vinpocetine does not fully support a benefit in either dementia or stroke. As of 2003, three controlled clinical trials had tested \"older adults with memory problems\". </p><p>Vinpocetine has also been studied for the prevention and recovery of acquired hearing loss in a phase II, longitudinal and prospective open clinical study on humans. </p> <p>Use during pregnancy may harm the baby or result in miscarriage. </p><p>Adverse effects of vinpocetine include flushing, nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, transient hypo- and hyper-tension, headaches, heartburn, and decreased blood pressure. FDA issued a statement in 2019 warning that \"vinpocetine may cause a miscarriage or harm fetal development\". </p> <div><h2 >Mechanism of action</h2><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Vinpocetine&action=edit&section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Mechanism of action\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Vinpocetine's mechanism of action has been postulated to involve three potential effects: blockage of sodium channels, reduction of cellular calcium influx, and antioxidant activity. Studies have also suggested that vinpocetine can inhibit PDE-1 in isolated rabbit aorta; inhibit IKK in vitro, preventing IκB degradation and the following translocation of NF-κB to the cell nucleus; and increase DOPAC, a metabolic breakdown product of dopamine, in isolated striatal nerve endings of rats. </p> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Vinpocetine_Life_Extension.jpg\"><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Vinpocetine_Life_Extension.jpg/250px-Vinpocetine_Life_Extension.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"200\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Vinpocetine_Life_Extension.jpg/330px-Vinpocetine_Life_Extension.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Vinpocetine_Life_Extension.jpg/500px-Vinpocetine_Life_Extension.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1365\" data-file-height=\"1920\"></a><figcaption>Vinpocetine tablets sold by the supplement company Life Extension, 10mg per tablet</figcaption></figure> <p>The inclusion of vinpocetine in dietary supplements in the U.S. has come under scrutiny due to the lack of defined dosage parameters, unproven short- and long-term benefits, and risks to human health. In the U.S., vinpocetine supplements are marketed as sports supplements, brain enhancers, and weight loss supplements. </p><p>A 2015 analysis of 23 brands of vinpocetine dietary supplements sold at GNC and Vitamin Shoppe retail stores reported widespread labeling errors. Only 6 of the 23 supplement labels (26%) provided consumers with accurate dosages of vinpocetine (ranging from 0.3 to 32&#160;mg per recommended daily serving), while 6 of 23 (26%) contained no vinpocetine at all, despite their labels claiming that the ingredient was in them. In total, 9 of the 23 products tested were mislabeled, and 17 of 23 (74%) did not provide any information on the quantity of vinpocetine. </p><p>In response to the study, then-senator Claire McCaskill, while at the time serving as the top Democrat on the Senate Special Committee on Aging, urged the FDA to suspend sales of vinpocetine supplements and asked 10 retailers to voluntarily stop selling vinpocetine products. McCaskill stated: \"The way we regulate these supplements isn't working—and it's putting the lives and well-being of consumers at risk. We've seen products with false labels, tainted ingredients, wildly illegal claims, and, now, products containing synthesized ingredients that are classified as prescription drugs in other countries.\" </p> <p>Procera AVH is a dietary supplement containing undisclosed amounts of vinpocetine in combination with huperzine&#160;A and acetyl-l-carnitine. In 2012, manufacturer Brain Research Labs (BRL) agreed to pay $500,000 to settle a class action lawsuit which alleged that the company had falsely marketed Procera AVH as capable of improving brain function, in violation of the Consumer Fraud Act. </p><p>In July 2015, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ruled that marketing claims for Procera AVH, which promoted the product as a \"solution\" to memory loss and cognitive decline, were false, misleading, unsubstantiated, and in violation of the FTC Act. BRL and its affiliated companies Brain Power Partners, Brain Power Founders, and MedHealth Direct (all based in Laguna Beach, California) were fined $91&#160;million. KeyView Labs, the Tampa, Florida-based company that purchased BRL in 2012, was fined $61&#160;million. Also named in the FTC complaint were George Reynolds (aka Josh Reynolds), founder and chief science officer of BRL, and John Arnold, the sole officer and employee of MedHealth. The FTC complaint charged Reynolds with making deceptive expert endorsements for Procera AVH. The defendants in the case ultimately agreed to pay $1.4&#160;million to settle the allegations of deceptive advertising brought by the FTC and California law enforcement officials. In addition, a permanent injunction barred the defendants from making similar deceptive claims about Procera AVH in the future and from misrepresenting the existence, results, or conclusions of any scientific study. </p> <div><ol> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-MedEx_1-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-MedEx_1-1\"></a> <cite><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://medex.com.bd/index.php/brands/31553/cavinton-5-mg-tablet\">\"Cavinton Tablet\"</a>. <i>MedEx</i>.</cite></span> </li> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-FDA2019Preg_2-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-FDA2019Preg_2-1\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-FDA2019Preg_2-2\"></a> <cite >Office of the Commissioner (3 June 2019). <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://downloads.regulations.gov/FDA-2019-P-3266-0009/attachment_10.pdf\">\"Statement on warning for women of childbearing age about possible safety risks of dietary supplements containing vinpocetine\"</a> (PDF). <i>U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</i>.

          "abstract": "Background: Stroke survivors are at significantly increased risk of cognitive impairment, which affects patients' independence of activities of daily living (ADLs), social engagement, and neurological function deficit. Many studies have been done to evaluate the efficacy and safety of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) treatment, and due to the largely inconsistent clinical data, there is a need to summarize and analyze the published clinical research data in this area. Objective: An umbrella review was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PSCI therapies. Methods: Three independent authors searched for meta-analyses and systematic reviews on PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science to address this issue. We examined ADL and Barthel index (BI), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), neurological function deficit as efficacy endpoints, and the incidence of adverse events as safety profiles. Results: In all, 312 studies from 19 eligible publications were included in the umbrella review. The results showed that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, cell therapies, acupuncture, and EGB76 can improve the MoCA and ADL, and the adverse effects were mild for the treatment of PSCI. Moreover, Vinpocetine, Oxiracetam, Citicoline, thrombolytic therapy, Actovegin, DL-3-n-Butylphthalide, and Nimodipine showed adverse events or low article quality in patients with PSCI. However, the research evidence is not exact and further research is needed. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that ACEI inhibitors (Donepezil) and NMDA antagonists (Memantine), EGB761, and acupuncture are the ADL and BI, MoCA, and neurological function deficit medication/therapy, respectively, for patients with PSCI.

          "abstract": "The first nootropic prohibited in sport was fonturacetam (4-phenylpiracetam, carphedon) in 1998. Presented here 25&#x2009;years later is a broad-scale consideration of the history, pharmacology, prevalence, regulations, and doping potential of nootropics viewed through a lens of 50 selected dietary supplements (DS) marketed as \"cognitive enhancement,\" \"brain health,\" \"brain boosters,\" or \"nootropics,\" with a focus on unauthorized ingredients. Nootropic DS have risen to prominence over the last decade often as multicomponent formulations of bioactive ingredients presenting compelling pharmacological questions and potential public health concerns. Many popular nootropics are unauthorized food or DS ingredients according to the European Commission including huperzine A, yohimbine, and dimethylaminoethanol; unapproved pharmaceuticals like phenibut or emoxypine (mexidol); previously registered drugs like meclofenoxate or reserpine; EU authorized pharmaceuticals like piracetam or vinpocetine; infamous doping agents like methylhexaneamine or dimethylbutylamine; and other investigational substances and peptides. Several are authorized DS ingredients in the United States resulting in significant global variability as to what qualifies as a legal nootropic. Prohibited stimulants or &#xdf;2-agonists commonly used in \"pre-workout,\" \"weight loss,\" or \"thermogenic\" DS such as octodrine, hordenine, or higenamine are often stacked with nootropic substances. While stimulants and &#xdf;2-agonists are defined as doping agents by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), many nootropics are not, although some may qualify as non-approved substances or related substances under catch-all language in the WADA Prohibited List. Synergistic combinations, excessive dosing, or recently researched pharmacology may justify listing certain nootropics as doping agents or warrant additional attention in future regulations.",

It was developed in the Soviet Union in 1969 and further studied in both Russia and Japan as a prodrug of GABA. </p><p>In Russia, picamilon is sold as a prescription drug. The rights to the drug belong to the Russian pharmaceutical company NPK ECHO (\"НПК ЭХО\"). It is not approved for sale in the United States and has been deemed an adulterating agent in dietary supplements, with five American companies required to remove their picamilon products from the market in November 2015. However, as recently as 2020, picamilon has been found in pharmaceutical dosages in over-the-counter supplements in the US. </p> <meta property=\"mw:PageProp/toc\"> <p>In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration ruled in 2015 that picamilon does not fit any of the dietary ingredient categories in the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, namely that it is not a vitamin; a dietary mineral; an herb or other botanical; an amino acid; a dietary substance for use by humans to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any ingredient described above that had been marketed in the United States before 1994.

Further work showed it crosses the blood-brain barrier in mice and rats. It is believed that picamilon is hydrolyzed into GABA and niacin, similar to the way tocopheryl nicotinate (vitamin E nicotinate) is hydrolyzed. GABA in the brain would activate GABA receptors, which in theory should have an anxiolytic effect. The second released component, niacin, is a vasodilator. A 2023 assay study showed that picamilon itself is inactive against 50 biological targets, including GABA receptors, despite being a GABA analogue. </p> <p>Plasma picamilon concentrations are generally in the 500–3000 <i>μ</i>g/L range during the first few hours after single oral doses of 50–200&#160;mg. It exhibits linear pharmacokinetics with a half-life of 1–2 hours. As discussed previously, the drug undergoes hydrolysis to GABA and nicotinic acid. Urinary excretion of parent drug and the two metabolites accounts for up to 79% of a single dose. </p> <ul><li>List of Russian drugs</li></ul> <div> <ol> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b> <cite><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230324212002/https://www.fda.gov/food/dietary-supplement-ingredient-directory/picamilon-dietary-supplements\">\"Picamilon in Dietary Supplements\"</a>. <i>FDA</i>.

It was developed in the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union) in 1969[[3]](#cite_note-Some_approaches_to_the_directed_search_for_new_drugs_based_on_nicotinic_acid-3) and further studied in both [Russia](/wiki/Russia)[[4]](#cite_note-pmid2707413-4) and [Japan](/wiki/Japan) as a [prodrug](/wiki/Prodrug) of GABA.[[5]](#cite_note-pmid6529802-5)\nIn Russia, picamilon is sold as a prescription drug. The rights to the drug belong to the Russian pharmaceutical company NPK ECHO (\"НПК ЭХО\"). It is not approved for sale in the United States and has been deemed an adulterating agent in [dietary supplements](/wiki/Dietary_supplements),[[6]](#cite_note-DTA2015-6) with five American companies required to remove their picamilon products from the market in November 2015.[[7]](#cite_note-nutra-7)  However, as recently as 2020, picamilon has been found in pharmaceutical dosages in over-the-counter supplements in the US.[[8]](#cite_note-neuro-8)\n\nIn the United States, the [Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) ruled in 2015 that picamilon does not fit any of the dietary ingredient categories in the [Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994](/wiki/Dietary_Supplement_Health_and_Education_Act_of_1994),[[7]](#cite_note-nutra-7)[[9]](#cite_note-9) namely that it is not a [vitamin](/wiki/Vitamin); a [dietary mineral](/wiki/Dietary_mineral); an [herb](/wiki/Herb) or other [botanical](/wiki/Botanical); an [amino acid](/wiki/Amino_acid); a dietary substance for use by humans to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any ingredient described above that had been marketed in the United States before 1994. Despite the FDA ruling, picamilon remains an ingredient in supplements marketed as nootropics in the US.[[8]](#cite_note-neuro-8)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Picamilon.jpg/250px-Picamilon.jpg)](/wiki/File:Picamilon.jpg)Picamilon 20 mg from Russia\nA Russian study from 1991 showed that picamilon permeated the [blood–brain barrier](/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier) in cats and increased cerebral blood flow.[[10]](#cite_note-pmid1884802-10) Further work showed it crosses the blood-brain barrier in mice and rats.[[11]](#cite_note-11) It is believed that picamilon is [hydrolyzed](/wiki/Hydrolyzed) into GABA and niacin, similar to the way tocopheryl nicotinate (vitamin E nicotinate) is hydrolyzed.[[12]](#cite_note-12) GABA in the brain would activate [GABA receptors](/wiki/GABA_receptor), which in theory should have an [anxiolytic](/wiki/Anxiolytic) effect.[[13]](#cite_note-pmid2884549-13) The second released component, [niacin](/wiki/Niacin_(substance)), is a [vasodilator](/wiki/Vasodilator).[[14]](#cite_note-pmid17705685-14)[[15]](#cite_note-pmid15673472-15) A 2023 assay study showed that picamilon itself is inactive against 50 biological targets, including GABA receptors, despite being a [GABA analogue](/wiki/GABA_analogue).[[16]](#cite_note-16)\n\nPlasma picamilon concentrations are generally in the 500–3000 *μ*g/L range during the first few hours after single oral doses of 50–200&#160;mg.[[2]](#cite_note-cui-2) It exhibits linear pharmacokinetics with a [half-life](/wiki/Half-life) of 1–2 hours.[[2]](#cite_note-cui-2) As discussed previously, the drug undergoes hydrolysis to GABA and nicotinic acid.

There is a lack of in silico, in vitro and in vivo data on the safety of picamilon. Therefore, to ascertain potential physiological effects of picamilon, it was screened against 50 safety-related biological targets (receptors, ion channels, enzymes and transporters) by in silico and in vitro methods. Using two in silico tools, picamilon was not predicted to bind to the targets. Similarly, picamilon exhibited weak or no binding to the targets when measured in vitro at 10&#xa0;&#x3bc;M. Overall, this data shows that picamilon, although structurally similar to other GABA analogues, has a different biological target binding profile. Picamilon's lack of binding to the 50 targets fills important data gaps among GABA analogues, a group of structurally related substances found in drugs and other consumer products.",

DMBA is an analogue of the pharmaceutical stimulant, 1,3-dimethylamylamine (DMAA), which was recently banned by the US Food and Drug Administration. We obtained all dietary supplements sold by US distributors that listed an ingredient on the label, such as AMP Citrate, that might be a marketing name for DMBA. Supplements were analyzed for the presence and quantity of DMBA. Fourteen supplements met our inclusion criteria and were analyzed by two separate laboratories using ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) - mass spectrometry and a reference standard. The identity of DMBA was confirmed in 12 supplements in the range of 13 to 120&#x2009;mg DMBA per serving. Following recommendations on the supplement label for maximum daily intake, customers would consume from 26 to 320&#x2009;mg of DMBA per day. Supplements containing DMBA were marketed to improve athletic performance, increase weight loss and enhance brain function. DMBA has never before been detected in supplements. The stimulant has never been studied in humans; its efficacy and safety are entirely unknown. Regulatory agencies should act expeditiously to warn consumers and remove DMBA from all dietary supplements.",

It is taken by mouth. </p><p>Oxilofrine acts as a norepinephrine releasing agent and hence is an indirectly acting sympathomimetic. It is a substituted amphetamine and is closely related to ephedrine (with oxilofrine also being known as 4-hydroxyephedrine). </p><p>Oxilofrine was first developed in the 1930s. It is mostly no longer marketed today. </p> <meta property=\"mw:PageProp/toc\"> <p>Oxilofrine is described as an ephedrine-like indirectly acting sympathomimetic and antihypotensive agent. It acts as a norepinephrine releasing agent and indirectly activates the α- and β-adrenergic receptors. The drug has positive inotropic effects (increases myocardial contractility). </p> <p>As an α-adrenergic receptor agonist, Oxilofrine activates the Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor. Activation of said receptor causes vasoconstriction, which is likely how it treats cough. By that mechanism, secretion of mucus into the airway would be dampened, thus reducing the urge to cough. It's also postulated that Oxilofrine acts as a sigma-1 receptor agonist, since it shares structural similarities to dextromethorphan and methamphetamine, two other sigma-1 receptor agonists. </p> <p>Oxilofrine, also known as 4,β-dihydroxy-<i>N</i>-methyl-α-methylphenethylamine or as 4,β-dihydroxy-<i>N</i>-methylamphetamine, is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine derivative. It is the racemic 4-hydroxylated analogue of ephedrine ((1<i>R</i>,2<i>S</i>)-β-hydroxy-<i>N</i>-methylamphetamine). It is also related to pholedrine (4-hydroxy-<i>N</i>-methylamphetamine). </p><p>The predicted log P of oxilofrine ranges from -0.13 to 0.6. It is more hydrophilic than ephedrine, which has an experimental log P of 1.13 and a predicted log P of 0.9 to 1.32. </p> <p>Oxilofrine was originally developed in the 1930s as a cardiac stimulant. Trade names included Suprifen (Bayer) and, combined with an adenosine-containing standardized organ extract, Carnigen (Hoechst AG). </p><p>In combination with normethadone, it was marketed as a cough suppressant under the trade name Ticarda. As of 2021, this formulation was still manufactured in Canada by Valeant and sold as Cophylac. </p><p>Several other sympathomimetics and vasodilators were developed as chemical derivatives of oxilofrine, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Beta-2_adrenergic_receptor\" title=\"Beta-2 adrenergic receptor\">β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor</a> agonists buphenine and isoxsuprine. </p> <div><h2 >Society and culture</h2><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Oxilofrine&action=edit&section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Society and culture\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p><i>Oxilofrine</i> is the generic name of the drug and its <a href=\"/wiki/International_Nonproprietary_Name\" title=\"International Nonproprietary Name\"><abbr title=\"International Nonproprietary Name\">INN</abbr></a>Tooltip International Nonproprietary Name.

It has been found as an adulterant in some dietary supplements. Even after receiving warning letters from the FDA, some sports and weight loss supplement companies continue to use oxilofrine as an undeclared ingredient in their products despite it being prohibited. </p> <div><h4 >List of doping cases</h4><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Oxilofrine&action=edit&section=9\" title=\"Edit section: List of doping cases\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Several doping cases involving oxilofrine have been publicized, including: </p> <ul><li>In 2009, Brazilian/American cyclist Flávia Oliveira was suspended for 2 years after taking a supplement known as \"HyperDrive 3.0+\" which contained methylsynephrine, a chemical equivalent of oxilofrine, among other substances. Her sentence was eventually reduced to 18 months after an appeal as there was enough evidence that she had unknowingly consumed said substance as the old label did not list methylsynephrine.</li> <li>On 18 September 2010, Vietnamese weightlifter Hoàng Anh Tuấn, silver medalist in 2008 Summer Olympics was handed a four-year ban, later reduced to two years, for testing positive with the substance. It was found out that the substance came from unlabeled drinks he consumed during his training in China.</li> <li>On July 14, 2013, Jamaican runners Asafa Powell and Sherone Simpson tested positive for oxilofrine prior to the 2013 World Athletics Championships. Powell, however, maintained that he did not take any banned supplements knowingly or willfully. Powell voluntarily withdrew as a result of the test. On 10 April 2014, both athletes received an 18-month suspension from competing, which was set to expire in December that year. However, after appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), both athletes' suspensions were lifted on 14 July 2014.</li> <li>On July 16, 2015, Red Sox pitching prospect Michael Kopech was suspended without pay for 50 games after testing positive for oxilofrine, which is a banned substance under the Minor League Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. Kopech denied knowingly taking the substance.</li> <li>In October 2018, the WBO stripped boxer Billy Joe Saunders of its middleweight world title after he tested positive for oxilofrine, as a result of a drug test administered by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA). In his defense, Saunders held that while the substance was proscribed by VADA it was not banned \"out of competition\" by UK Anti-Doping, or the British Boxing Board of Control, but this appeal was rejected.</li></ul> <p>Oxilofrine is a known metabolite of <a href=\"/wiki/Para-methoxymethamphetamine\" title=\"Para-methoxymethamphetamine\"><i>para</i>-methoxymethamphetamine</a> (PMMA). </p> <div><ol> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-DrugBank_1-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-DrugBank_1-1\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-DrugBank_1-2\"></a> <cite><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB11610\">\"Oxilofrine: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action\"</a>. <i>DrugBank Online</i>. 31 December 1957.

Activation of said receptor causes [vasoconstriction](/wiki/Vasoconstriction), which is likely how it treats [cough](/wiki/Cough). By that mechanism, secretion of mucus into the airway would be dampened, thus reducing the urge to cough.[[11]](#cite_note-11) It's also postulated that Oxilofrine acts as a [sigma-1 receptor](/wiki/Sigma-1_receptor) agonist, since it shares structural similarities to [dextromethorphan](/wiki/Dextromethorphan) and [methamphetamine](/wiki/Methamphetamine), two other [sigma-1 receptor](/wiki/Sigma-1_receptor) agonists.\n\nOxilofrine, also known as 4,β-dihydroxy-*N*-methyl-α-methylphenethylamine or as 4,β-dihydroxy-*N*-methylamphetamine, is a [substituted phenethylamine](/wiki/Substituted_phenethylamine) and [amphetamine](/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) [derivative](/wiki/Chemical_derivative).[[4]](#cite_note-IndexNominum2000-4)[[10]](#cite_note-Drugs.com-International-10) It is the [racemic](/wiki/Racemic_mixture) 4-[hydroxylated](/wiki/Hydroxyl_group) [analogue](/wiki/Structural_analogue) of [ephedrine](/wiki/Ephedrine) ((1*R*,2*S*)-β-hydroxy-*N*-methylamphetamine).[[4]](#cite_note-IndexNominum2000-4) It is also related to [pholedrine](/wiki/Pholedrine) (4-hydroxy-*N*-methylamphetamine).[[4]](#cite_note-IndexNominum2000-4)\nThe predicted [log P](/wiki/Partition_coefficient) of oxilofrine ranges from -0.13 to 0.6.[[12]](#cite_note-PubChem-12)[[1]](#cite_note-DrugBank-1)[[13]](#cite_note-ChemSpider-13) It is more [hydrophilic](/wiki/Hydrophilic) than ephedrine, which has an experimental log P of 1.13 and a predicted log P of 0.9 to 1.32.[[14]](#cite_note-PubChem-Ephedrine-14)[[15]](#cite_note-DrugBank-Ephedrine-15)[[16]](#cite_note-ChemSpider-Ephedrine-16)\n\nOxilofrine was originally developed in the 1930s as a [cardiac stimulant](/wiki/Cardiac_stimulant). Trade names included Suprifen ([Bayer](/wiki/Bayer)) and, combined with an [adenosine](/wiki/Adenosine)-containing standardized organ extract, Carnigen ([Hoechst AG](/wiki/Hoechst_AG)).[[9]](#cite_note-Cohen2017-9)\nIn combination with [normethadone](/wiki/Normethadone), it was marketed as a [cough suppressant](/wiki/Antitussive) under the trade name Ticarda. As of 2021, this formulation was still manufactured in Canada by [Valeant](/wiki/Bausch_Health) and sold as Cophylac.[[17]](#cite_note-Cophylac-Label-17)\nSeveral other sympathomimetics and [vasodilators](/wiki/Vasodilator) were developed as chemical derivatives of oxilofrine, such as the [β2-adrenergic receptor](/wiki/Beta-2_adrenergic_receptor) [agonists](/wiki/Agonist) [buphenine](/wiki/Buphenine) and [isoxsuprine](/wiki/Isoxsuprine).[[18]](#cite_note-KülzSchneider1950-18)[[19]](#cite_note-Freedman1955-19)\n\n## Society and culture\n\n*Oxilofrine* is the [generic name](/wiki/Generic_term) of the drug and its [INN](/wiki/International_Nonproprietary_Name)Tooltip International Nonproprietary Name.[[4]](#cite_note-IndexNominum2000-4)[[7]](#cite_note-MortonHall2012-7)[[10]](#cite_note-Drugs.com-International-10) It is also known by synonyms including *methylsynephrine*, *oxyphedrine*, and *hydroxyephedrine*.[[4]](#cite_note-IndexNominum2000-4)[[10]](#cite_note-Drugs.com-International-10) Brand names of oxilofrine include *Carnigen*, *Cophylac* (with [normethadone](/wiki/Normethadone)), *Suprifen*, and *Ticarda* (also with normethadone), among others.[[4]](#cite_note-IndexNominum2000-4)[[10]](#cite_note-Drugs.com-International-10)[[9]](#cite_note-Cohen2017-9)\n\nOxilofrine has been marketed in [Austria](/wiki/Austria), [Canada](/wiki/Canada), and [Germany](/wiki/Germany).[[4]](#cite_note-IndexNominum2000-4)[[10]](#cite_note-Drugs.com-International-10)\n\n### Use in exercise and sports\n\nOxilofrine is currently a [World Anti-Doping Agency](/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency) (WADA) prohibited substance when used in competition.[[20]](#cite_note-20) It has been found as an [adulterant](/wiki/Adulterant) in some dietary supplements.[[9]](#cite_note-Cohen2017-9)[[21]](#cite_note-21) Even after receiving warning letters from the FDA,[[22]](#cite_note-22) some sports and weight loss supplement companies continue to use oxilofrine as an undeclared ingredient in their products despite it being prohibited.[[23]](#cite_note-23)\n\n#### List of doping cases\n\nSeveral [doping](/wiki/Doping_in_sport) cases involving oxilofrine have been publicized, including:\n\n- In 2009, Brazilian/American cyclist [Flávia Oliveira](/wiki/Fl%C3%A1via_Oliveira) was suspended for 2 years after taking a supplement known as \"HyperDrive 3.0+\" which contained methylsynephrine, a chemical equivalent of oxilofrine, among other substances.[[24]](#cite_note-24) Her sentence was eventually reduced to 18 months after an appeal as there was enough evidence that she had unknowingly consumed said substance as the old label did not list methylsynephrine.[[25]](#cite_note-25)\n\n- On 18 September 2010, Vietnamese weightlifter [Hoàng Anh Tuấn](/wiki/Ho%C3%A0ng_Anh_Tu%E1%BA%A5n), silver medalist in [2008 Summer Olympics](/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics) was handed a four-year ban, later reduced to two years, for testing positive with the substance. It was found out that the substance came from unlabeled drinks he consumed during his training in China.[[26]](#cite_note-26)\n\n- On July 14, 2013, Jamaican runners [Asafa Powell](/wiki/Asafa_Powell) and [Sherone Simpson](/wiki/Sherone_Simpson) tested positive for oxilofrine prior to the [2013 World Athletics Championships](/wiki/2013_World_Championships_in_Athletics).[[27]](#cite_note-27) Powell, however, maintained that he did not take any banned supplements knowingly or willfully.[[28]](#cite_note-bp-28) Powell voluntarily withdrew as a result of the test. On 10 April 2014, both athletes received an 18-month suspension from competing, which was set to expire in December that year.[[29]](#cite_note-Powell_and_Simpson_suspended-29) However, after appealing to the [Court of Arbitration for Sport](/wiki/Court_of_Arbitration_for_Sport) (CAS), both athletes' suspensions were lifted on 14 July 2014.[[30]](#cite_note-30)\n\n- On July 16, 2015, [Red Sox](/wiki/Red_Sox) pitching prospect [Michael Kopech](/wiki/Michael_Kopech) was suspended without pay for 50 games after testing positive for oxilofrine, which is a banned substance under the Minor League Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. Kopech denied knowingly taking the substance.[[31]](#cite_note-31)\n\n- In October 2018, the [WBO](/wiki/WBO) stripped boxer [Billy Joe Saunders](/wiki/Billy_Joe_Saunders) of its middleweight world title after he tested positive for oxilofrine, as a result of a drug test administered by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA). In his defense, Saunders held that while the substance was proscribed by VADA it was not banned \"out of competition\" by [UK Anti-Doping](/wiki/UK_Anti-Doping), or the [British Boxing Board of Control](/wiki/British_Boxing_Board_of_Control), but this appeal was rejected.[[32]](#cite_note-32)\n\nOxilofrine is a known [metabolite](/wiki/Metabolite) of [*para*-methoxymethamphetamine](/wiki/Para-methoxymethamphetamine) (PMMA).[[6]](#cite_note-Docherty2008-6)\n\n^ [***a***](#cite_ref-DrugBank_1-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-DrugBank_1-1) [***c***](#cite_ref-DrugBank_1-2) [\"Oxilofrine: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action\"](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB11610). *DrugBank Online*. 31 December 1957.

Recently, the food supplement Dexaprine was removed from the Dutch market because it was associated with severe adverse events. Reports to the Dutch Poisons Information Center (DPIC) showed that ingestion of as little as half a tablet caused several cases of nausea, agitation, tachycardia, and palpitations and even one case of cardiac arrest. The remaining tablets of four patients were sent in by different healthcare professionals. Analysis by ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass-spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) confirmed the presence of synephrine, oxilofrine, deterenol, yohimbine, caffeine, and theophylline. Two more compounds were found which were tentatively identified as &#x3b2;-methyl-&#x3b2;-phenylethylamines. This incident is only the next in a series of similar incidents involving dietary supplements with (undeclared) active substances that are either unsafe or have no known safety profile.",

Chemically, hordenine is the <i>N</i>-methyl derivative of <a href=\"/wiki/N-Methyltyramine\" title=\"N-Methyltyramine\"><i>N</i>-methyltyramine</a>, and the <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-dimethyl derivative of the well-known biogenic amine tyramine, from which it is biosynthetically derived and with which it shares some pharmacological properties (see below). As of September 2012, hordenine is widely sold as an ingredient of nutritional supplements, with sellers claiming that it stimulates the central nervous system and promotes weight loss by enhancing metabolism. In experiments in which animals are given sufficiently large doses parenterally (by injection), hordenine produces an increase in blood pressure as well as other disturbances of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and nervous systems. These effects are generally not reproduced by oral administration of the drug in test animals, and virtually no scientific reports of the effects of hordenine in human beings have been published. </p> <meta property=\"mw:PageProp/toc\"> <p>The first report of the isolation from a natural source of the compound now known as hordenine was made by Arthur Heffter in 1894, who extracted this alkaloid from the cactus <i>Anhalonium fissuratus</i> (now reclassified as <i>Ariocarpus fissuratus</i>), naming it \"anhalin\". Twelve years later, E. Léger independently isolated an alkaloid, which he named hordenine, from germinated barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) seeds. Ernst Späth subsequently showed that these alkaloids were identical and proposed the correct molecular structure for the substance, for which the name \"hordenine\" was ultimately retained. </p><p>Hordenine is present in a fairly wide range of plants, notably amongst the cacti, but has also been detected in some algae and fungi. It occurs in grasses, and is found at significantly high concentrations in the seedlings of cereals such as barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) (about 0.2%, or 2000 μg/g), proso millet (<i>Panicum miliaceum</i>) (about 0.2%), and sorghum (<i>Sorghum vulgare</i>) (about 0.1%). Reti, in his 1953 review of naturally occurring phenethylamines, notes that the richest source of hordenine is the cactus <i>Trichocereus candicans</i> (now reclassified as <i>Echinopsis candicans</i>), which was found to contain 0.5–5.0% of the alkaloid. </p><p>Because barley, via its conversion to malt, is used extensively in the production of beer, beer and malt have been examined by several groups of investigators for the presence of hordenine. Citing a 1965 study by McFarlane, Poocharoen reported that beer contained ~ 12–24&#160;mg/L, wort contained about 11–13&#160;mg/L, and malt contained about 67 μg/g of hordenine. The hordenine content of various malts and malt fractions was extensively studied by Poocharoen himself, who also provided a good coverage of related literature up to 1983. This researcher found a mean concentration of hordenine in raw barley around 0.7 μg/g; in green malts (i.e. barley that had been soaked in water for 2 days then germinated for 4 days), the mean concentration was about 21 μg/g, and in kilned malts (i.e. green malts that had been heated in a kiln for 1–2 days), the mean concentration was about 28 μg/g. When only green malt roots were examined, their mean content of hordenine was roughly 3363 μg/g, whereas the mean level in kilned malt roots was around 4066 μg/g. </p><p>In barley, hordenine levels reach a maximum within 5–11 days of germination, then slowly decrease until only traces remain after one month. Furthermore, hordenine is localized primarily in the roots. In comparing literature values for hordenine concentrations in \"barley\" or barley \"malt\", therefore, consideration should be made of the age and parts of the plant being analyzed: the figure of about 2,000 μg/g cited in the review by Smith, for example, is consistent with Poocharoen's figures for the hordenine levels in the <i>roots</i> of malted barley, but not in \"whole\" malt, where his figures of 21-28 μg/g are more consistent with McFarlane's figure of about 67 μg/g. However, a wide range of variability is seen; a study by Lovett and co-workers of 43 different barley lines found concentrations of hordenine in roots ranging from 1 to 2625 μg/g fresh weight. These workers concluded that hordenine production was not under significant genetic control, but much more susceptible to environmental factors such as light duration. </p> <p>Hordenine is biosynthesized by the stepwise <i>N</i>-methylation of tyramine, which is first converted to <a href=\"/wiki/N-Methyltyramine\" title=\"N-Methyltyramine\"><i>N</i>-methyltyramine</a>, and which, in turn is methylated to hordenine. The first step in this sequence is accomplished by the enzyme tyramine N-methyltransferase (tyramine methylpherase), but if the same enzyme is responsible for the second methylation that actually produces hordenine is uncertain. </p> <p>Since the hordenine molecule contains both a basic (amine) and acidic (phenol) functional group, it is amphoteric. </p><p>The apparent (see original article for discussion) pK<sub>a</sub>s for protonated hordenine are 9.78 (phenolic H) and 10.02 (ammonium H). </p><p>Common salts are hordenine hydrochloride, R-NH<sub>3</sub>Cl, m.p.&#160;178&#160;°C, and hordenine sulfate, (R-NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, m.p.&#160;211&#160;°C. </p><p>The \"<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Methyl_hordenine_HCl&action=edit&redlink=1\" title=\"Methyl hordenine HCl (page does not exist)\">methyl hordenine HCl</a>\" which is listed as an ingredient on the labels of some nutritional supplements is in all likelihood simply hordenine hydrochloride, since the \"description\" of \"methyl hordenine HCl\" given by virtually all bulk suppliers of this substance corresponds to that for hordenine hydrochloride (or possibly just hordenine). Five <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Regioisomeric&action=edit&redlink=1\" title=\"Regioisomeric (page does not exist)\">regioisomeric</a> compounds would correspond to the name \"methyl hordenine HCl\", if it were interpreted according to the rules of chemical nomenclature: <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=%CE%91-methyl_hordenine&action=edit&redlink=1\" title=\"Α-methyl hordenine (page does not exist)\">α-methyl hordenine</a>, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=%CE%92-methyl_hordenine&action=edit&redlink=1\" title=\"Β-methyl hordenine (page does not exist)\">β-methyl hordenine</a>, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=2-methyl_hordenine&action=edit&redlink=1\" title=\"2-methyl hordenine (page does not exist)\">2-methyl hordenine</a>, <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=3-methyl_hordenine&action=edit&redlink=1\" title=\"3-methyl hordenine (page does not exist)\">3-methyl hordenine</a>, and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=4-O-methyl_hordenine&action=edit&redlink=1\" title=\"4-O-methyl hordenine (page does not exist)\">4-O-methyl hordenine</a> - each in the form of its HCl salt; <i>N</i>-methyl hordenine is better known as the natural product candicine, but is excluded from the possibilities because it is a quaternary ammonium salt that cannot be protonated, hence cannot form a hydrochloride salt. </p> <p>The first synthesis of hordenine was reported in 1909 by Barger in which 2-phenylethyl alcohol was first converted to 2-phenylethyl chloride using PCl<sub>5</sub>; this chloride was reacted with dimethylamine to form N,N-dimethyl-phenylethylamine, which was then nitrated using HNO<sub>3</sub>; the N,N-dimethyl-4-nitro-phenethylamine was reduced to N,N-dimethyl-4-amino-phenethylamine with Sn/HCl; this amine was finally converted to hordenine by diazotization/hydrolysis using NaNO<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O. </p><p>A more efficient synthetic route was described by Chang and coworkers, who also provided references to earlier syntheses. This synthesis began with <i>p</i>-methoxy-phenylethyl alcohol, which was simultaneously <i>O</i>-demethylated and converted to the iodide by heating with HI; the resulting p-hydroxy-phenylethyl iodide was then heated with dimethylamine to give hordenine. </p><p>Radio-labelled hordenine has been prepared by the hydrogenation of a mixture of 2-[C]-tyramine and 40% formaldehyde in the presence of 10% Pd-on-charcoal catalyst. The labelled C in the hordenine is thus the C which is β- to the N. </p><p>Hordenine labelled with C at the position α- to the N has also been prepared, </p> <p>The pharmacokinetics of hordenine have been studied in horses. After IV administration of the drug, the α-phase T<sub>1/2</sub> was found to be about 3 mins., and the β-phase T<sub>1/2</sub> was about 35 mins. </p> <p>The first pharmacological study of hordenine to be recorded is that of Heffter, who was also the first to isolate it. Using the sulfate salt (see \"Chemistry\"), Heffter gave a subcutaneous dose of 0.3 g to a 2.8-kg cat (about 107&#160;mg/kg), and observed no effects besides violent vomiting; the cat behaved normally within 45 mins. He also took a dose of 100&#160;mg orally himself, without experiencing any observable effect. However, the alkaloid was observed to produce a paralysis of the nervous system in frogs. </p><p>The cardiovascular and other effects of hordenine were reviewed in detail by Reitschel, writing in 1937. </p><p>More modern studies were carried out by Frank and coworkers, who reported that IV administration of 2&#160;mg/kg of hordenine to horses produced substantial respiratory distress, increased the rate of respiration by 250%, doubled the heart rate, and caused sweating without changes in basal body temperature or behavior. All effects disappeared within 30 mins. The same dose of hordenine given orally did not produce any of the effects seen after parenteral administration. </p><p>In a 1995 study, Hapke and Strathmann reported that in dogs and rats, hordenine produced a positive inotropic effect on the heart (i.e. increased the strength of contraction), increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and increased the volume of peripheral blood flow. Movements of the gut were inhibited. Additional experiments on isolated tissue lead these investigators to conclude that hordenine was an indirectly acting adrenergic agent that produced its pharmacological effects by releasing stored norepinephrine (NE). </p><p>Hordenine was found to be a selective substrate for MAO-B, from rat liver, with K<sub>m</sub> = 479 μM, and V<sub>max</sub> = 128 nM/mg protein/h. It was not deaminated by MAO-A from rat intestinal epithelium. </p><p>In contrast to tyramine, hordenine did not produce contraction of isolated rat vas deferens, but a 25 μM concentration of the drug did potentiate its response to submaximal doses of NE, and inhibited its response to tyramine. However, the response to NE of isolated vas deferens taken from rats chronically treated with guanethidine was not affected by hordenine. The investigators concluded that hordenine acted as an inhibitor of NE reuptake in rat vas deferens. </p><p>Hordenine has been found to be a potent stimulant of gastrin release in the rat, being essentially equipotent with N-methyltyramine: 83 nM/kg of hordenine (corresponding to about 14&#160;mg/kg of the free base) enhancing gastrin release by roughly 60%. </p><p>In a study of the effects of a large number of compounds on a rat trace amine receptor (rTAR1) expressed in HEK 293 cells, hordenine, at a concentration of 1 μM, had almost identical potency to that of the same concentration of β-phenethylamine in stimulating cAMP production through the rTAR1. The potency of tyramine in this receptor preparation was slightly higher than that of hordenine. </p> <p>Working with Léger's (see \"Occurrence\") hordenine sulfate, Camus determined minimum lethal doses for the dog, rabbit, guinea pig, and rat (see \"Toxicology\"). The associated symptoms of toxicity following parenteral doses were: excitation, vomiting, respiratory difficulties, convulsions, and paralysis, with death occurring as a result of respiratory arrest. In a subsequent paper, Camus reported that the intravenous (IV) administration of some hundreds of mg of hordenine sulfate to dogs or rabbits caused an increase in blood pressure and changes in the rhythm and force of contraction of the heart, noting also that the drug was not orally active. </p><p>LD<sub>50</sub> in mice, by intraperitoneal (IP) administration: 299&#160;mg/kg. Other LD<sub>50</sub> values given in the literature are: &gt;100&#160;mg/kg (mouse; IP), as HCl salt: 113.5&#160;mg/kg (mouse; route of administration unspecified) Minimum lethal dose (as sulfate salt): 300&#160;mg/kg (dog; IV); 2000&#160;mg/kg (dog; oral); 250&#160;mg/kg (rabbit; IV); 300&#160;mg/kg (guinea pig; IV); 2000&#160;mg/kg (guinea pig; subcutaneous); about 1000&#160;mg/kg (rat; subcutaneous). </p><p>From experiments aimed at identifying the toxin responsible for producing the locomotor disorder (\"staggers\") and rapidly lethal cardiac toxicosis (\"sudden death\") periodically observed in livestock feeding on the grass <i>Phalaris aquatica</i>, Australian researchers determined that the lowest doses of hordenine that would induce symptoms of \"staggers\" in sheep were 20&#160;mg/kg IV, and 800&#160;mg/kg orally. However, the cardiac symptoms of \"sudden death\" could not be evinced by hordenine. </p><p>Although hordenine is capable of reacting with nitrosating agents (e.g. nitrite ion, NO<sub>2</sub>) to form the carcinogen <a href=\"/wiki/N-nitrosodimethylamine\" title=\"N-nitrosodimethylamine\"><i>N</i>-nitrosodimethylamine</a> (NDMA), and was investigated as a possible precursor for the significant amounts of NDMA once found in beer, it was eventually established that the levels of hordenine present in malt were too low to account for the observed levels of NDMA. </p> <div><h2 >Insect interactions</h2><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hordenine&action=edit&section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Insect interactions\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Hordenine has been found to act as a feeding deterrent to grasshoppers (<i>Melanoplus bivittatus</i>), and to caterpillars of <i>Heliothis virescens</i> and <i>Heliothis subflexa</i>; the estimated concentration of hordenine that reduced feeding duration to 50% of control was 0.4M for <i>H. virescens</i> and 0.08M for <i>H. subflexa</i>. </p> <p>Hordenine has some plant growth-inhibiting properties: Liu and Lovett reported that, at a concentration of 50 ppm, it reduced the radicle length in seedlings of white mustard (<i>Sinapis alba</i>) by around 7%; admixture with an equal amount of gramine markedly enhanced this inhibitory effect. </p> <ul><li>Tyramine</li> <li>N-Methyltyramine</li> <li>Candicine</li> <li>N,N-Dimethyldopamine</li> <li>4-Hydroxyamphetamine</li> <li>Pholedrine</li> <li>O-desmethylvenlafaxine</li> <li>Venlafaxine</li></ul> <div><ol data-mw-group=\"lower-alpha\"> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-11\">^</a></b> The level of hordenine in ungerminated barley is negligible, but rises as germination (the first part of the \"malting\" process) proceeds. </li> </ol></div> <div><ol> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Heffter_1894_1-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Heffter_1894_1-1\"></a> <cite >Heffter A (1894). \"Über Pellote\". <i>Arch.

Chemically, hordenine is the *N*-methyl [derivative](/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)) of [*N*-methyltyramine](/wiki/N-Methyltyramine), and the *N*,*N*-dimethyl derivative of the well-known [biogenic amine](/wiki/Biogenic_amine) [tyramine](/wiki/Tyramine), from which it is biosynthetically derived and with which it shares some pharmacological properties (see below). As of September 2012, hordenine is widely sold as an ingredient of nutritional supplements, with sellers claiming that it stimulates the [central nervous system](/wiki/Central_nervous_system) and promotes weight loss by enhancing metabolism. In experiments in which animals are given sufficiently large doses parenterally (by injection), hordenine produces an increase in [blood pressure](/wiki/Blood_pressure) as well as other disturbances of the [cardiovascular](/wiki/Cardiovascular_system), respiratory, and [nervous systems](/wiki/Nervous_system). These effects are generally not reproduced by oral administration of the drug in test animals, and virtually no scientific reports of the effects of hordenine in human beings have been published.\n\nThe first report of the isolation from a natural source of the compound now known as hordenine was made by [Arthur Heffter](/wiki/Arthur_Heffter) in 1894, who extracted this alkaloid from the cactus *Anhalonium fissuratus* (now reclassified as *[Ariocarpus fissuratus](/wiki/Ariocarpus_fissuratus)*), naming it \"anhalin\".[[1]](#cite_note-Heffter_1894-1) Twelve years later, E. Léger independently isolated an alkaloid, which he named hordenine, from germinated [barley](/wiki/Barley) (*Hordeum vulgare*) seeds.[[2]](#cite_note-2) [Ernst Späth](/wiki/Ernst_Sp%C3%A4th) subsequently showed that these alkaloids were identical and proposed the correct molecular structure for the substance, for which the name \"hordenine\" was ultimately retained.[[3]](#cite_note-3)\nHordenine is present in a fairly wide range of plants, notably amongst the cacti,[[4]](#cite_note-4) but has also been detected in some algae and fungi.[[5]](#cite_note-5)[[6]](#cite_note-Smith_1977-6)[[7]](#cite_note-7) It occurs in grasses, and is found at significantly high concentrations in the seedlings of cereals such as [barley](/wiki/Barley) (*[Hordeum vulgare](/wiki/Hordeum_vulgare)*) (about 0.2%, or 2000 μg/g), [proso millet](/wiki/Proso_millet) (*[Panicum miliaceum](/wiki/Panicum_miliaceum)*) (about 0.2%), and [sorghum](/wiki/Sorghum) (*[Sorghum vulgare](/wiki/Sorghum_vulgare)*) (about 0.1%).[[6]](#cite_note-Smith_1977-6) Reti, in his 1953 review of naturally occurring phenethylamines, notes that the richest source of hordenine is the cactus *Trichocereus candicans* (now reclassified as *[Echinopsis candicans](/wiki/Echinopsis_candicans)*), which was found to contain 0.5–5.0% of the alkaloid.[[8]](#cite_note-8)\nBecause barley, via its conversion to [malt](/wiki/Malt), is used extensively in the production of [beer](/wiki/Beer), beer and malt have been examined by several groups of investigators for the presence of hordenine. Citing a 1965 study by McFarlane,[[9]](#cite_note-McFarlane_1965-9) Poocharoen reported that beer contained ~ 12–24&#160;mg/L, [wort](/wiki/Wort) contained about 11–13&#160;mg/L, and malt contained about 67 μg/g of hordenine.[[10]](#cite_note-Poocharoen_1983-10) The hordenine content of various malts and malt fractions was extensively studied by Poocharoen himself, who also provided a good coverage of related literature up to 1983. This researcher found a mean concentration of hordenine in raw barley[[a]](#cite_note-11) around 0.7 μg/g; in green malts (i.e. barley that had been soaked in water for 2 days then germinated for 4 days), the mean concentration was about 21 μg/g, and in kilned malts (i.e. green malts that had been heated in a kiln for 1–2 days), the mean concentration was about 28 μg/g. When only green malt roots were examined, their mean content of hordenine was roughly 3363 μg/g, whereas the mean level in kilned malt roots was around 4066 μg/g.[[10]](#cite_note-Poocharoen_1983-10)\nIn barley, hordenine levels reach a maximum within 5–11 days of germination, then slowly decrease until only traces remain after one month. Furthermore, hordenine is localized primarily in the roots.[[11]](#cite_note-Mann-12) In comparing literature values for hordenine concentrations in \"barley\" or barley \"malt\", therefore, consideration should be made of the age and parts of the plant being analyzed: the figure of about 2,000 μg/g cited in the review by Smith,[[6]](#cite_note-Smith_1977-6) for example, is consistent with Poocharoen's [[10]](#cite_note-Poocharoen_1983-10) figures for the hordenine levels in the *roots* of malted barley, but not in \"whole\" malt, where his figures of 21-28 μg/g are more consistent with McFarlane's figure of about 67 μg/g.[[9]](#cite_note-McFarlane_1965-9) However,  a wide range of variability is seen; a study by Lovett and co-workers of 43 different barley lines found concentrations of hordenine in roots  ranging from 1 to 2625 μg/g fresh weight. These workers concluded that hordenine production was not under significant genetic control, but much more susceptible to environmental factors such as light duration.[[12]](#cite_note-13)\n\nHordenine is biosynthesized by the stepwise *N*-methylation of [tyramine](/wiki/Tyramine), which is first converted to [*N*-methyltyramine](/wiki/N-Methyltyramine), and which, in turn is methylated to hordenine. The first step in this sequence is accomplished by the enzyme [tyramine N-methyltransferase](/wiki/Tyramine_N-methyltransferase) (tyramine  methylpherase), but if the same enzyme is responsible for the second methylation that actually produces hordenine is uncertain.[[11]](#cite_note-Mann-12)[[13]](#cite_note-14)\n\nSince the hordenine molecule contains both a basic (amine) and acidic (phenol) functional group, it is [amphoteric](/wiki/Amphoteric).\nThe apparent (see original article for discussion) pKas for protonated hordenine are 9.78 (phenolic H) and 10.02 (ammonium H).[[14]](#cite_note-15)\nCommon salts are hordenine hydrochloride,[[15]](#cite_note-16) R-NH3+Cl−, m.p.&#160;178&#160;°C, and hordenine sulfate,[[16]](#cite_note-17) (R-NH3+)2SO42−, m.p.&#160;211&#160;°C.\nThe \"[methyl hordenine HCl](/w/index.php?title=Methyl_hordenine_HCl&action=edit&redlink=1)\" which is listed as an ingredient on the labels of some nutritional supplements is in all likelihood simply hordenine hydrochloride, since the \"description\" of \"methyl hordenine HCl\" given by virtually all bulk suppliers of this substance corresponds to that for hordenine hydrochloride (or possibly just hordenine).[[17]](#cite_note-18)\nFive [regioisomeric](/w/index.php?title=Regioisomeric&action=edit&redlink=1) compounds would correspond to the name \"methyl hordenine HCl\", if it were interpreted according to the rules of chemical nomenclature: [α-methyl hordenine](/w/index.php?title=%CE%91-methyl_hordenine&action=edit&redlink=1), [β-methyl hordenine](/w/index.php?title=%CE%92-methyl_hordenine&action=edit&redlink=1), [2-methyl hordenine](/w/index.php?title=2-methyl_hordenine&action=edit&redlink=1), [3-methyl hordenine](/w/index.php?title=3-methyl_hordenine&action=edit&redlink=1), and [4-O-methyl hordenine](/w/index.php?title=4-O-methyl_hordenine&action=edit&redlink=1) - each in the form of its HCl salt; *N*-methyl hordenine is better known as the natural product [candicine](/wiki/Candicine), but is excluded from the possibilities because it is a [quaternary ammonium salt](/wiki/Quaternary_ammonium_salt) that cannot be protonated, hence cannot form a hydrochloride salt.\n\nThe first synthesis of hordenine was reported in 1909 by Barger in which 2-phenylethyl alcohol was first converted to 2-phenylethyl chloride using PCl5; this chloride was reacted with dimethylamine to form N,N-dimethyl-phenylethylamine, which was then nitrated using HNO3; the N,N-dimethyl-4-nitro-phenethylamine was reduced to N,N-dimethyl-4-amino-phenethylamine with Sn/HCl; this amine was finally converted to hordenine by diazotization/hydrolysis using NaNO2/H2SO4/H2O.[[18]](#cite_note-19)\nA more efficient synthetic route was described by Chang and coworkers, who also provided references to earlier syntheses. This synthesis began with *p*-methoxy-phenylethyl alcohol, which was simultaneously *O*-demethylated and converted to the iodide by heating with HI; the resulting p-hydroxy-phenylethyl iodide was then heated with dimethylamine to give hordenine.[[19]](#cite_note-20)\nRadio-labelled hordenine has been prepared by the [hydrogenation](/wiki/Hydrogenation) of a mixture of 2-[14C]-tyramine and 40% [formaldehyde](/wiki/Formaldehyde) in the presence of 10% Pd-on-charcoal catalyst. The labelled C in the hordenine is thus the C which is β- to the N.[[20]](#cite_note-21)\nHordenine labelled with 14C at the position α- to the N has also been prepared,[[21]](#cite_note-22)\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of hordenine have been studied in horses. After IV administration of the drug, the α-phase T1/2 was found to be about 3 mins., and the β-phase T1/2 was about 35 mins.[[22]](#cite_note-Frank_1990-23)\n\nThe first pharmacological study of hordenine to be recorded is that of Heffter, who was also the first to isolate it. Using the sulfate salt (see \"Chemistry\"), Heffter gave a subcutaneous dose of 0.3 g to a 2.8-kg cat (about 107&#160;mg/kg), and observed no effects besides violent vomiting; the cat behaved normally within 45 mins. He also took a dose of 100&#160;mg orally himself, without experiencing any observable effect. However, the alkaloid was observed to produce a paralysis of the nervous system in frogs.[[1]](#cite_note-Heffter_1894-1)\nThe cardiovascular and other effects of hordenine were reviewed in detail by Reitschel, writing in 1937.[[23]](#cite_note-24)\nMore modern studies were carried out by Frank and coworkers, who reported that IV administration of  2&#160;mg/kg of hordenine to horses produced substantial respiratory distress, increased the rate of respiration by 250%, doubled the heart rate, and caused sweating without changes in basal body temperature or behavior. All effects disappeared within 30 mins. The same dose of hordenine given orally did not produce any of the effects seen after parenteral administration.[[22]](#cite_note-Frank_1990-23)\nIn a 1995 study, Hapke and Strathmann reported that in dogs and rats, hordenine produced a positive inotropic effect on the heart (i.e. increased the strength of contraction), increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and increased the volume of peripheral blood flow. Movements of the gut were inhibited. Additional experiments on isolated tissue lead these investigators to conclude that hordenine was an indirectly acting [adrenergic](/wiki/Adrenergic) agent that produced its pharmacological effects by releasing stored [norepinephrine](/wiki/Norepinephrine) (NE).[[24]](#cite_note-Hapke_1995-25)\nHordenine was found to be a selective substrate for [MAO-B](/wiki/MAO-B), from rat liver, with Km = 479 μM, and Vmax = 128 nM/mg protein/h. It was not deaminated by [MAO-A](/wiki/MAO-A) from rat intestinal epithelium.[[25]](#cite_note-Barwell_1989-26)\nIn contrast to [tyramine](/wiki/Tyramine), hordenine did not produce contraction of isolated rat [vas deferens](/wiki/Vas_deferens), but a 25 μM concentration of the drug did potentiate its response to submaximal doses of NE, and inhibited its response to tyramine. However, the response to NE of isolated vas deferens taken from rats chronically treated with [guanethidine](/wiki/Guanethidine) was not affected by hordenine. The investigators concluded that hordenine acted as an inhibitor of NE reuptake in rat vas deferens.[[25]](#cite_note-Barwell_1989-26)\nHordenine has been found to be a potent stimulant of [gastrin](/wiki/Gastrin) release in the rat, being essentially equipotent with [N-methyltyramine](/wiki/N-methyltyramine): 83 nM/kg of hordenine (corresponding to  about 14&#160;mg/kg of the free base) enhancing gastrin release by roughly 60%.[[26]](#cite_note-27)\nIn a study of the effects of a large number of compounds on a rat [trace amine receptor](/wiki/Trace_amine_receptor) (rTAR1) expressed in [HEK 293](/wiki/HEK_293) cells, hordenine, at a concentration of 1 μM, had almost identical potency to that of the same concentration of β-phenethylamine in stimulating [cAMP](/wiki/Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate) production through the rTAR1. The potency of tyramine in this receptor preparation was slightly higher than that of hordenine.[[27]](#cite_note-28)\n\nWorking with Léger's (see \"Occurrence\") hordenine sulfate, Camus determined minimum lethal doses for the dog, rabbit, guinea pig, and rat (see \"Toxicology\"). The associated symptoms of toxicity following parenteral doses were: excitation, vomiting, respiratory difficulties, convulsions, and paralysis, with death occurring as a result of respiratory arrest.[[28]](#cite_note-Cam-29) In a subsequent paper, Camus reported that the intravenous (IV) administration of some hundreds of mg of hordenine sulfate to dogs or rabbits caused an increase in blood pressure and changes in the rhythm and force of contraction of the heart, noting also that the drug was not orally active.[[29]](#cite_note-30)\nLD50 in mice, by intraperitoneal (IP) administration: 299&#160;mg/kg.[[30]](#cite_note-31) Other LD50 values given in the literature are: >100&#160;mg/kg (mouse; IP),[[31]](#cite_note-32) as HCl salt: 113.5&#160;mg/kg (mouse; route of administration unspecified)[[32]](#cite_note-33) Minimum lethal dose (as sulfate salt): 300&#160;mg/kg (dog; IV); 2000&#160;mg/kg (dog; oral); 250&#160;mg/kg (rabbit; IV); 300&#160;mg/kg (guinea pig; IV); 2000&#160;mg/kg (guinea pig; subcutaneous); about 1000&#160;mg/kg (rat; subcutaneous).[[28]](#cite_note-Cam-29)\nFrom experiments aimed at identifying the toxin responsible for producing the locomotor disorder (\"staggers\") and rapidly lethal cardiac toxicosis (\"sudden death\") periodically observed in livestock feeding on the grass *[Phalaris aquatica](/wiki/Phalaris_aquatica)*, Australian researchers determined that the lowest doses of hordenine that would induce symptoms of \"staggers\" in sheep were 20&#160;mg/kg IV, and 800&#160;mg/kg orally. However, the cardiac symptoms of \"sudden death\" could not be evinced by hordenine.[[33]](#cite_note-34)\nAlthough hordenine is capable of reacting with [nitrosating agents](/wiki/Nitrosating_agent) (e.g. [nitrite](/wiki/Nitrite) ion, NO2−) to form the [carcinogen](/wiki/Carcinogen) [*N*-nitrosodimethylamine](/wiki/N-nitrosodimethylamine) (NDMA), and was investigated as a possible precursor for the significant amounts of NDMA once found in beer,[[10]](#cite_note-Poocharoen_1983-10) it was eventually established that the levels of hordenine present in malt were too low to account for the observed levels of NDMA.[[34]](#cite_note-35)\n\n## Insect interactions\n\nHordenine has been found to act as a feeding deterrent to grasshoppers (*Melanoplus bivittatus*),[[35]](#cite_note-36) and to caterpillars of *Heliothis virescens* and *Heliothis subflexa*; the estimated concentration of hordenine that reduced feeding duration to 50% of control was 0.4M for *H. virescens* and 0.08M for *H. subflexa*.[[36]](#cite_note-37)\n\nHordenine has some plant growth-inhibiting properties: Liu and Lovett reported that, at a concentration of 50 ppm, it reduced the radicle length in seedlings of white mustard (*Sinapis alba*) by around 7%; admixture with an equal amount of [gramine](/wiki/Gramine) markedly enhanced this inhibitory effect.[[37]](#cite_note-38)\n\n- [Tyramine](/wiki/Tyramine)\n\n- [N-Methyltyramine](/wiki/N-Methyltyramine)\n\n- [Candicine](/wiki/Candicine)\n\n- [N,N-Dimethyldopamine](/wiki/N,N-Dimethyldopamine)\n\n- [4-Hydroxyamphetamine](/wiki/4-Hydroxyamphetamine)\n\n- [Pholedrine](/wiki/Pholedrine)\n\n- [O-desmethylvenlafaxine](/wiki/O-desmethylvenlafaxine)\n\n- [Venlafaxine](/wiki/Venlafaxine)\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-11)** The level of hordenine in ungerminated barley is negligible, but rises as germination (the first part of the \"malting\" process) proceeds.[[10]](#cite_note-Poocharoen_1983-10)\n\n^ [***a***](#cite_ref-Heffter_1894_1-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-Heffter_1894_1-1) Heffter A (1894). \"Über Pellote\". *Arch.

          "abstract": "Hordenine, a phenethylamine alkaloid, is found in a variety of plants and exhibits a broad array of biological activities and pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. However, the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of hordenine in treating ulcerative colitis (UC) remain unclear. To address this, we examined the therapeutic effects of hordenine on dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced UC by comparing disease activity index (DAI), colon length, secretion of inflammatory factors, and degree of colonic histological lesions across diseased mice that were and were not treated with hordenine. We found that hordenine significantly reduced DAI and levels of pro-inflammatory factors, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1&#x3b2;, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;), and also alleviated colon tissue oedema, colonic lesions, inflammatory cells infiltration and decreased the number of goblet cells. Moreover, in vitro experiments showed that hordenine protected intestinal epithelial barrier function by increasing the expression of tight junction proteins including ZO-1 and occludin, while also promoting the healing of intestinal mucosa. Using immunohistochemistry and western blotting, we demonstrated that hordenine reduced the expression of sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1), sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1), and ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), and it inhibited the expression of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) in colon tissues. Thus, hordenine appears to be effective in UC treatment owing to pharmacological mechanisms that favor mucosal healing and the inhibition of SPHK-1/S1PR1/STAT3 signaling.",

          "abstract": "The first nootropic prohibited in sport was fonturacetam (4-phenylpiracetam, carphedon) in 1998. Presented here 25&#x2009;years later is a broad-scale consideration of the history, pharmacology, prevalence, regulations, and doping potential of nootropics viewed through a lens of 50 selected dietary supplements (DS) marketed as \"cognitive enhancement,\" \"brain health,\" \"brain boosters,\" or \"nootropics,\" with a focus on unauthorized ingredients. Nootropic DS have risen to prominence over the last decade often as multicomponent formulations of bioactive ingredients presenting compelling pharmacological questions and potential public health concerns. Many popular nootropics are unauthorized food or DS ingredients according to the European Commission including huperzine A, yohimbine, and dimethylaminoethanol; unapproved pharmaceuticals like phenibut or emoxypine (mexidol); previously registered drugs like meclofenoxate or reserpine; EU authorized pharmaceuticals like piracetam or vinpocetine; infamous doping agents like methylhexaneamine or dimethylbutylamine; and other investigational substances and peptides. Several are authorized DS ingredients in the United States resulting in significant global variability as to what qualifies as a legal nootropic. Prohibited stimulants or &#xdf;2-agonists commonly used in \"pre-workout,\" \"weight loss,\" or \"thermogenic\" DS such as octodrine, hordenine, or higenamine are often stacked with nootropic substances. While stimulants and &#xdf;2-agonists are defined as doping agents by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), many nootropics are not, although some may qualify as non-approved substances or related substances under catch-all language in the WADA Prohibited List. Synergistic combinations, excessive dosing, or recently researched pharmacology may justify listing certain nootropics as doping agents or warrant additional attention in future regulations.",

Octopamine is often considered the major \"fight-or-flight\" neurohormone of invertebrates. Its name is derived from the fact that it was first identified in the salivary glands of the octopus. </p><p>In many types of invertebrates, octopamine is an important neurotransmitter and hormone. In protostomes—arthropods, molluscs, and several types of worms—it substitutes for norepinephrine and performs functions apparently similar to those of norepinephrine in mammals, functions that have been described as mobilizing the body and nervous system for action. In mammals, octopamine is found only in trace amounts (i.e., it is a trace amine), and no biological function has been solidly established for it. It is also found naturally in numerous plants, including bitter orange. </p><p>Octopamine has been sold under trade names such as <b>Epirenor</b>, <b>Norden</b>, and <b>Norfen</b> for use as a sympathomimetic drug, available by prescription. </p> <meta property=\"mw:PageProp/toc\"> <p>Octopamine exerts its effects by binding to and activating receptors located on the surface of cells. These receptors have mainly been studied in insects, where they can be divided into distinct types: </p> <ol><li>OctαR (alpha-adrenergic-like), are structurally and functionally similar to noradrenergic alpha-1 receptors in mammals. There are multiple subtypes of the OctαR receptor. For example, the kissing bug (<i>Rhodnius prolixus</i>) has Octα<sub>1</sub>-R, Octα<sub>2</sub>R.</li> <li>OctβR (beta-adrenergic-like), are structurally and functionally similar to noradrenergic beta receptors in mammals. There are multiple subtypes of the OctβR receptor. For example, the fruit fly (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>) has DmOctβ1R, DmOctβ2R, and DmOctβ3R.</li> <li>OAMB. The diversity of this receptor is relatively unknown. The fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) has two distinct isoforms which are functionally distinct: Oamb and Oamb.</li> <li>TyrR (mixed octopamine/tyramine receptors), which are structurally and functionally similar to noradrenergic alpha-2 receptors in mammals. Receptors in the TyrR class, however, are generally more strongly activated by tyramine than by octopamine.</li></ol> <p>Phylogenetic studies claim that in ancient bilaterians such as <i>Platynereis dumerilii</i> there is a co-existence of norepinephrine, tyramine and octopamine receptor signaling. However, due to partial overlapping in their signalling functionality tyramine and octopamine receptors have been lost in vertebrates. </p><p>In vertebrates no octopamine-specific receptors have been identified. Octopamine binds weakly to receptors for norepinephrine and epinephrine, but it is not clear whether this has any functional significance. It binds more strongly to trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs), especially TAAR1. </p> <p>Octopamine was first discovered by Italian scientist Vittorio Erspamer in 1948 in the salivary glands of the octopus and has since been found to act as a neurotransmitter, neurohormone and neuromodulator in invertebrates. Although Erspamer discovered its natural occurrence and named it, octopamine had actually existed for many years as a pharmaceutical product. It is widely used in energy-demanding behaviors by all insects, crustaceans (crabs, lobsters, crayfish), and spiders. Such behaviors include modulating muscle tension, flying, ovulation and egg-laying, and jumping. </p> <div><h4 >In non-insect invertebrates</h4><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Octopamine&action=edit&section=4\" title=\"Edit section: In non-insect invertebrates\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>In lobsters, octopamine seems to direct and coordinate neurohormones to some extent in the central nervous system, and it was observed that injecting octopamine into a lobster and crayfish resulted in limb and abdomen extension. </p><p>In the nematode, octopamine is found in high concentrations in adults, decreasing egg-laying and pharyngeal pumping behaviors with an antagonistic effect to serotonin. </p><p>Octopaminergic nerves in the mollusc may be present in the heart, with high concentrations in the nervous system. </p> <div><h4 >In non-<i>Drosophila</i> insects</h4><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Octopamine&action=edit&section=5\" title=\"Edit section: In non-Drosophila insects\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>In insects, octopamine is released by a select number of neurons, but acts broadly throughout the central brain, on all sense organs, and on several non-neuronal tissues. In the thoracic ganglia, octopamine is primarily released by DUM (dorsal unpaired median) and VUM (ventral unpaired median) neurons, which release octopamine onto neural, muscular, and peripheral targets. These neurons are important for mediating energy-demanding motor behaviors, such as escape-induced jumping and flight. For example, the locust DUMeti neuron releases octopamine onto the extensor tibia muscle to increase muscle tension and increase relaxation rate. These actions promote efficient leg muscle contraction for jumping. During flight, DUM neurons are also active and release octopamine throughout the body to synchronize energy metabolism, respiration, muscle activity and flight interneuron activity. Octopamine in locusts is four times more concentrated in the axon than in the soma, and decreases the locust's myogenic rhythm. </p><p>In the honey bee, octopamine has a major role in learning and memory. In the firefly, octopamine release leads to light production in the lantern. </p><p>In larvae of the oriental armyworm, octopamine is immunologically beneficial, increasing survival rates in high-density populations. </p><p>The emerald cockroach wasp stings the host for its larvae (a cockroach) in the head ganglion (brain). The venom blocks octopamine receptors and the cockroach fails to show normal escape responses, grooming itself excessively. It becomes docile and the wasp leads it to the wasp's den by pulling its antenna like a leash. </p> <p>Octopamine affects almost every process of the fruit fly and is widely present in both the adult and larval fly. A non-exhaustive list of some of the areas in which Octopamine modulates: </p> <ul><li>Learning and memory</li> <li>Ovulation and Egg-Laying</li> <li>Locomotion</li> <li>Muscle Physiology</li> <li>Aggression</li> <li>Alcohol and drug tolerance</li> <li>Feeding</li> <li>Microbiome and gut physiology</li> <li>Sleep</li> <li>Modulating effects of exercise</li> <li>Metabolism</li></ul> <p>In vertebrates, octopamine replaces norepinephrine in sympathetic neurons with chronic use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors. It may be responsible for the common side effect of orthostatic hypotension with these agents, though there is also evidence that it is actually mediated by increased levels of <a href=\"/wiki/N-acetylserotonin\" title=\"N-acetylserotonin\"><i>N</i>-acetylserotonin</a>. </p><p>One study noted that octopamine might be an important amine that influences the therapeutic effects of inhibitors such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, especially because a large increase in octopamine levels was observed when animals were treated with this inhibitor. Octopamine was positively identified in the urine samples of mammals such as humans, rats, and rabbits treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Very small amounts of octopamine were also found in certain animal tissues. It was observed that within a rabbit's body, the heart and kidney held the highest concentrations of octopamine. Octopamine was found to be 93% eluted by urine within 24 hours of being produced in the body as a byproduct of Iproniazid in rabbits. </p> <p>Octopamine has been sold under trade names such as <b>Epirenor</b>, <b>Norden</b>, and <b>Norfen</b> for use in medicine as a sympathomimetic drug, available by prescription. However, very little information exists concerning its clinical usefulness or safety. It has been studied as an antihypotensive agent and has been shown to increase blood pressure when administered intravenously, intramuscularly, and buccally at sufficiently high doses, whereas oral administration was ineffective. </p><p>Octopamine is an analogue of sympathomimetic catecholamines like norepinephrine and phenethylamines like tyramine. However, octopamine has 400- to 2,000-fold lower affinity for the mammalian α- and β-adrenergic receptors than norepinephrine. In any case, it can produce significant sympathomimetic effects, like pressor responses, at sufficiently high doses. </p><p>In mammals, octopamine may mobilize the release of fat from adipocytes (fat cells), which has led to its promotion on the internet as a slimming aid. However, the released fat is likely to be promptly taken up into other cells, and there is no evidence that octopamine facilitates weight loss. Octopamine may also increase blood pressure significantly when combined with other stimulants, as in some weight loss supplements. </p><p>The World Anti-Doping Agency lists octopamine as a banned substance for in competition use, as a \"specified stimulant\" on the 2019 Prohibited List. </p><p>In contrast to various other phenethylamines, octopamine is a poor or negligible substrate of the dopamine transporter (DAT). </p> <p>The octopamine receptor is a target of insecticides, as its blockage leads to decreased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Essential oils can have such a neuro-insecticidal effect, and this octopamine-receptor mechanism is naturally utilized by plants with active insecticidal phytochemicals. </p> <div><h2 >Biochemical mechanisms</h2><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Octopamine&action=edit&section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Biochemical mechanisms\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Octopamine is one of four primary endogenous agonists of human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) together with 3-iodothyronamine, dopamine and tyramine. </p> <p>Octopamine binds to its respective G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) to initiate a cell signal transduction pathway. At least three groups of octopamine GPCR have been defined. OctαR (OCTOPAMINE1 receptors) are more closely related to α-adrenergic receptors, while OctβR (OCTOPAMINE2 receptors) are more closely related to β-adrenergic receptors. The Octopamine/Tyramine receptors (including Oct-TyrR) can bind both ligands, and display agonist-specific coupling. Oct-TyrR is listed in both OCTOPAMINE and TYRAMINE RECEPTORS gene groups. </p> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:OA_Synthesis.svg\"><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/OA_Synthesis.svg/250px-OA_Synthesis.svg.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"250\" height=\"229\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/OA_Synthesis.svg/375px-OA_Synthesis.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/OA_Synthesis.svg/500px-OA_Synthesis.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"306\" data-file-height=\"280\"></a><figcaption>Invertebrate synthesis of Octopamine</figcaption></figure> <p>Octopamine acts as the insect equivalent of norepinephrine and has been implicated in regulating aggression in invertebrates, with different effects on different species.

Interestingly, two different G proteins G13 and Gs regulated TAAR1 activation (Underhill et al. 2019). It was further shown that AMPH induced activation of both TAAR1-G13-RhoA and TAAR1-Gs-PKA signaling were dependent on DAT (Underhill et al. 2019). However, the TAAR1 agonist octopamine, which is not a substrate of DAT, did not activate RhoA signaling. Accordingly, it was suggested that these TAAR1/RhoA and TAAR1/PKA signaling pathways might be particular cascades that mediate the effects of amphetamines and could not generalize to other TAAR1 agonists (Underhill et al. 2019).</q></cite></span> </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-UnderhillHullihenChen2021_64-0\">^</a></b> <cite >Underhill SM, Hullihen PD, Chen J, Fenollar-Ferrer C, Rizzo MA, Ingram SL, et&#160;al.

Octopamine is a potent activator of TAAR1 [4, 5] however, it is a poor substrate for DAT . Because the DAT dependence of the effects of TAAR1 agonists on RhoA activation suggests that TAAR1 agonists act intracellularly to stimulate the receptor, we permeablized the HEK293 cells with streptolysin O to allow octopamine access to the cytoplasm . In the presence of streptolysin O, octopamine produces an approximately twofold increase in activated Rho, whereas streptolysin O had no effect on its own, demonstrating that a TAAR1 agonist that is not a substrate for DAT can activate Rho-dependent signaling once it enters the cell. These studies also imply that entry through the DAT may not be prerequisite for activation of intracellular signaling by TAAR1; in fact, two recently-developed compounds from Roche (RO5166017 and RO5203648) show TAAR1 agonist activity in DAT KO mice and thus may gain access to the cell interior via other avenues [25, 26].</q></cite></span> </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-PörzgenParkHirsh2001_65-0\">^</a></b> <cite >Pörzgen P, Park SK, Hirsh J, Sonders MS, Amara SG (January 2001). \"The antidepressant-sensitive dopamine transporter in Drosophila melanogaster: a primordial carrier for catecholamines\". <i>Mol Pharmacol</i>. <b>59</b> (1): 83–95. doi:<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1124%2Fmol.59.1.83\">10.1124/mol.59.1.83</a>.

Octopamine is often considered the major \"fight-or-flight\" [neurohormone](/wiki/Neurohormone) of [invertebrates](/wiki/Invertebrate). Its name is derived from the fact that it was first identified in the [salivary glands](/wiki/Salivary_gland) of the [octopus](/wiki/Octopus).\nIn many types of invertebrates, octopamine is an important [neurotransmitter](/wiki/Neurotransmitter) and [hormone](/wiki/Hormone). In [protostomes](/wiki/Protostome)—[arthropods](/wiki/Arthropod), [molluscs](/wiki/Mollusc), and several types of [worms](/wiki/Worm)—it substitutes for norepinephrine and performs functions apparently similar to those of norepinephrine in mammals, functions that have been described as mobilizing the body and nervous system for action. In mammals, octopamine is found only in trace amounts (i.e., it is a [trace amine](/wiki/Trace_amine)), and no biological function has been solidly established for it. It is also found [naturally](/wiki/Natural_product) in numerous plants, including [bitter orange](/wiki/Bitter_orange).[[4]](#cite_note-TangTaoLuo2006-4)[[5]](#cite_note-pmid121158-5)\nOctopamine has been sold under trade names such as **Epirenor**, **Norden**, and **Norfen** for use as a [sympathomimetic drug](/wiki/Sympathomimetic_drug), available by prescription.\n\nOctopamine exerts its effects by binding to and activating receptors located on the surface of cells. These receptors have mainly been studied in insects, where they can be divided into distinct types:\n\n- OctαR ([alpha-adrenergic](/wiki/Adrenergic_receptor)-like), are structurally and functionally similar to noradrenergic alpha-1 receptors in mammals. There are multiple subtypes of the OctαR receptor. For example, the kissing bug (*[Rhodnius prolixus](/wiki/Rhodnius_prolixus)*) has Octα1-R, Octα2R.[[6]](#cite_note-6)\n\n- OctβR ([beta-adrenergic](/wiki/Beta-adrenergic)-like), are structurally and functionally similar to noradrenergic beta receptors in mammals. There are multiple subtypes of the OctβR receptor. For example, the fruit fly (*[Drosophila melanogaster](/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster)*) has DmOctβ1R, DmOctβ2R, and DmOctβ3R.[[7]](#cite_note-7)\n\n- OAMB. The diversity of this receptor is relatively unknown. The fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) has two distinct isoforms which are functionally distinct: OambK3 and OambAS.[[8]](#cite_note-8)\n\n- TyrR (mixed octopamine/tyramine receptors), which are structurally and functionally similar to noradrenergic alpha-2 receptors in mammals.[[9]](#cite_note-Pfluger3-9) Receptors in the TyrR class, however, are generally more strongly activated by [tyramine](/wiki/Tyramine) than by octopamine.[[9]](#cite_note-Pfluger3-9)\n\nPhylogenetic studies claim that in ancient [bilaterians](/wiki/Bilaterians) such as *[Platynereis dumerilii](/wiki/Platynereis_dumerilii)* there is a co-existence of [norepinephrine](/wiki/Norepinephrine), [tyramine](/wiki/Tyramine) and octopamine receptor signaling. However, due to partial overlapping in their signalling functionality tyramine and octopamine receptors have been lost in vertebrates.[[10]](#cite_note-10)\nIn vertebrates no octopamine-specific receptors have been identified. Octopamine binds weakly to receptors for [norepinephrine](/wiki/Norepinephrine) and [epinephrine](/wiki/Epinephrine), but it is not clear whether this has any functional significance. It binds more strongly to [trace amine-associated receptors](/wiki/Trace_amine-associated_receptor) (TAARs), especially [TAAR1](/wiki/TAAR1).[[9]](#cite_note-Pfluger3-9)\n\nOctopamine was first discovered by Italian scientist [Vittorio Erspamer](/wiki/Vittorio_Erspamer) in 1948[[11]](#cite_note-11) in the salivary glands of the [octopus](/wiki/Octopus) and has since been found to act as a [neurotransmitter](/wiki/Neurotransmitter), [neurohormone](/wiki/Neurohormone) and [neuromodulator](/wiki/Neuromodulator) in [invertebrates](/wiki/Invertebrate). Although Erspamer discovered its natural occurrence and named it, octopamine had actually existed for many years as a pharmaceutical product.[[12]](#cite_note-jbc3-12) It is widely used in energy-demanding behaviors by all insects, crustaceans (crabs, lobsters, crayfish), and spiders. Such behaviors include modulating muscle tension,[[13]](#cite_note-Action_of_octopamine_and_tyramine_o-13) flying,[[14]](#cite_note-:0-14) ovulation and egg-laying,[[15]](#cite_note-:6-15)[[16]](#cite_note-:3-16)[[17]](#cite_note-:4-17)[[18]](#cite_note-:5-18)[[19]](#cite_note-:7-19)[[20]](#cite_note-:8-20) and jumping.[[21]](#cite_note-21)[[22]](#cite_note-22)\n\n#### In non-insect invertebrates\n\nIn lobsters, octopamine seems to direct and coordinate [neurohormones](/wiki/Neurohormone) to some extent in the central nervous system, and it was observed that injecting octopamine into a lobster and crayfish resulted in limb and abdomen extension.[[23]](#cite_note-23)\nIn the [nematode](/wiki/Nematode), octopamine is found in high concentrations in adults, decreasing egg-laying and pharyngeal pumping behaviors with an antagonistic effect to [serotonin](/wiki/Serotonin).[[24]](#cite_note-24)\nOctopaminergic nerves in the [mollusc](/wiki/Mollusca) may be present in the heart, with high concentrations in the nervous system.[[25]](#cite_note-25)\n\n#### In non-*Drosophila* insects\n\nIn insects, octopamine is released by a select number of neurons, but acts broadly throughout the central brain, on all sense organs, and on several non-neuronal tissues.[[26]](#cite_note-:1-26)[[27]](#cite_note-27) In the thoracic ganglia, octopamine is primarily released by DUM (dorsal unpaired median) and VUM (ventral unpaired median) neurons, which release octopamine onto neural, muscular, and peripheral targets.[[28]](#cite_note-28)[[29]](#cite_note-29) These neurons are important for mediating energy-demanding motor behaviors, such as escape-induced jumping and flight. For example, the locust DUMeti neuron releases octopamine onto the extensor tibia muscle to increase muscle tension and increase relaxation rate. These actions promote efficient leg muscle contraction for jumping.[[26]](#cite_note-:1-26) During flight, DUM neurons are also active and release octopamine throughout the body to synchronize energy metabolism, respiration, muscle activity and flight interneuron activity.[[14]](#cite_note-:0-14) Octopamine in [locusts](/wiki/Locusts) is four times more concentrated in the axon than in the soma, and decreases the locust's [myogenic rhythm](/wiki/Myogenic_mechanism).[[30]](#cite_note-30)\nIn the [honey bee](/wiki/Honey_bee), octopamine has a major role in learning and memory. In the [firefly](/wiki/Firefly), octopamine release leads to light production in the lantern.[[31]](#cite_note-31)[[32]](#cite_note-32)\nIn larvae of the [oriental armyworm](/wiki/Mythimna_separata), octopamine is immunologically beneficial, increasing survival rates in high-density populations.[[33]](#cite_note-33)\nThe [emerald cockroach wasp](/wiki/Emerald_cockroach_wasp) stings the host for its larvae (a cockroach) in the head ganglion (brain). The venom blocks octopamine receptors[[34]](#cite_note-34) and the cockroach fails to show normal escape responses, grooming itself excessively. It becomes docile and the wasp leads it to the wasp's den by pulling its antenna like a leash.[[35]](#cite_note-35)\n\nOctopamine affects almost every process of the fruit fly and is widely present in both the adult and larval fly. A non-exhaustive list of some of the areas in which Octopamine modulates:\n\n- Learning and memory[[36]](#cite_note-36)[[37]](#cite_note-37)[[38]](#cite_note-38)\n\n- Ovulation and Egg-Laying[[15]](#cite_note-:6-15)[[16]](#cite_note-:3-16)[[17]](#cite_note-:4-17)[[18]](#cite_note-:5-18)[[19]](#cite_note-:7-19)[[20]](#cite_note-:8-20)\n\n- Locomotion[[39]](#cite_note-39)[[40]](#cite_note-40)[[41]](#cite_note-41)\n\n- Muscle Physiology[[13]](#cite_note-Action_of_octopamine_and_tyramine_o-13)[[42]](#cite_note-42)\n\n- Aggression[[43]](#cite_note-43)[[44]](#cite_note-44)[[45]](#cite_note-45)\n\n- Alcohol and drug tolerance[[46]](#cite_note-46)[[47]](#cite_note-47)[[48]](#cite_note-48)[[49]](#cite_note-49)\n\n- Feeding[[50]](#cite_note-50)[[51]](#cite_note-51)\n\n- Microbiome and gut physiology[[52]](#cite_note-52)[[53]](#cite_note-53)\n\n- Sleep[[54]](#cite_note-54)[[55]](#cite_note-55)\n\n- Modulating effects of exercise[[56]](#cite_note-56)[[57]](#cite_note-57)\n\n- Metabolism[[58]](#cite_note-58)[[59]](#cite_note-59)\n\nIn [vertebrates](/wiki/Vertebrate), octopamine replaces [norepinephrine](/wiki/Norepinephrine) in [sympathetic](/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system) [neurons](/wiki/Neuron) with chronic use of [monoamine oxidase inhibitors](/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_inhibitor). It may be responsible for the common [side effect](/wiki/Side_effect) of [orthostatic hypotension](/wiki/Orthostatic_hypotension) with these agents, though there is also evidence that it is actually mediated by increased levels of [*N*-acetylserotonin](/wiki/N-acetylserotonin).\nOne study noted that octopamine might be an important amine that influences the therapeutic effects of inhibitors such as [monoamine oxidase inhibitors](/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_inhibitor), especially because a large increase in octopamine levels was observed when animals were treated with this inhibitor. Octopamine was positively identified in the urine samples of mammals such as humans, rats, and rabbits treated with [monoamine oxidase inhibitors](/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_inhibitor). Very small amounts of octopamine were also found in certain animal tissues. It was observed that within a rabbit's body, the heart and kidney held the highest concentrations of octopamine. Octopamine was found to be 93% eluted by urine within 24 hours of being produced in the body as a byproduct of Iproniazid in rabbits.[[12]](#cite_note-jbc3-12)\n\nOctopamine has been sold under trade names such as **Epirenor**, **Norden**, and **Norfen** for use in medicine as a [sympathomimetic drug](/wiki/Sympathomimetic_drug), available by prescription. However, very little information exists concerning its clinical usefulness or safety.[[60]](#cite_note-Stohs2015-60) It has been studied as an [antihypotensive agent](/wiki/Antihypotensive_agent) and has been shown to increase [blood pressure](/wiki/Blood_pressure) when administered [intravenously](/wiki/Intravenous_injection), [intramuscularly](/wiki/Intramuscular_injection), and [buccally](/wiki/Buccal_administration) at sufficiently high doses, whereas [oral administration](/wiki/Oral_administration) was ineffective.[[60]](#cite_note-Stohs2015-60)\nOctopamine is an [analogue](/wiki/Structural_analog) of [sympathomimetic](/wiki/Sympathomimetic) [catecholamines](/wiki/Catecholamine) like [norepinephrine](/wiki/Norepinephrine) and [phenethylamines](/wiki/Substituted_phenethylamine) like [tyramine](/wiki/Tyramine).[[60]](#cite_note-Stohs2015-60) However, octopamine has 400- to 2,000-fold lower [affinity](/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)) for the mammalian [α-](/wiki/%CE%91-adrenergic_receptor) and [β-adrenergic receptors](/wiki/%CE%92-adrenergic_receptor) than norepinephrine.[[60]](#cite_note-Stohs2015-60) In any case, it can produce significant sympathomimetic effects, like pressor responses, at sufficiently high doses.[[60]](#cite_note-Stohs2015-60)\nIn [mammals](/wiki/Mammal), octopamine may mobilize the release of [fat](/wiki/Fat) from [adipocytes](/wiki/Adipocytes) (fat cells), which has led to its promotion on the [internet](/wiki/Internet) as a slimming aid. However, the released fat is likely to be promptly taken up into other cells, and there is no evidence that octopamine facilitates weight loss. Octopamine may also increase [blood pressure](/wiki/Blood_pressure) significantly when combined with other [stimulants](/wiki/Stimulant), as in some [weight loss supplements](/wiki/Anorectic).[[61]](#cite_note-61)\nThe [World Anti-Doping Agency](/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency) lists octopamine as a banned substance for in competition use, as a \"specified stimulant\"[[62]](#cite_note-62) on the 2019 Prohibited List.\nIn contrast to various other phenethylamines, octopamine is a poor or negligible [substrate](/wiki/Substrate_(biochemistry)) of the [dopamine transporter](/wiki/Dopamine_transporter) (DAT).[[63]](#cite_note-LiuWuLi2020-63)[[64]](#cite_note-UnderhillHullihenChen2021-64)[[65]](#cite_note-PörzgenParkHirsh2001-65)\n\nThe octopamine receptor is a target of insecticides, as its blockage leads to decreased [cyclic adenosine monophosphate](/wiki/Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate) (cAMP) levels. Essential oils can have such a neuro-insecticidal effect,[[66]](#cite_note-66) and this octopamine-receptor mechanism is naturally utilized by plants with active insecticidal phytochemicals.[[67]](#cite_note-67)\n\n## Biochemical mechanisms\n\nOctopamine is one of four primary [endogenous agonists](/wiki/Endogenous_agonist) of human [trace amine-associated receptor 1](/wiki/Trace_amine-associated_receptor_1) (TAAR1) together with [3-iodothyronamine](/wiki/3-iodothyronamine), [dopamine](/wiki/Dopamine) and [tyramine](/wiki/Tyramine).[[68]](#cite_note-TAAR1_IUPHAR-68)[[69]](#cite_note-69)\n\nOctopamine binds to its respective G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) to initiate a cell signal transduction pathway. At least three groups of octopamine GPCR have been defined. OctαR (OCTOPAMINE1 receptors) are more closely related to α-adrenergic receptors, while OctβR (OCTOPAMINE2 receptors) are more closely related to β-adrenergic receptors. The Octopamine/Tyramine receptors (including Oct-TyrR) can bind both ligands, and display agonist-specific coupling. Oct-TyrR is listed in both OCTOPAMINE and TYRAMINE RECEPTORS gene groups.[[70]](#cite_note-70)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/OA_Synthesis.svg/250px-OA_Synthesis.svg.png)](/wiki/File:OA_Synthesis.svg)Invertebrate synthesis of Octopamine\n\nOctopamine acts as the [insect](/wiki/Insect) equivalent of [norepinephrine](/wiki/Norepinephrine) and has been implicated in regulating [aggression](/wiki/Aggression) in [invertebrates](/wiki/Invertebrate), with different effects on different species. Studies have shown that reducing the neurotransmitter octopamine and preventing coding of [tyramine β-hydroxylase](/w/index.php?title=Tyramine_beta-hydroxylase&action=edit&redlink=1) (an [enzyme](/wiki/Enzyme) that converts [tyramine](/wiki/Tyramine) to octopamine) decreases aggression in *[Drosophila](/wiki/Drosophila)* without influencing other behaviors.[[71]](#cite_note-71)\n\nOctopamine, or *para*-octopamine, also known as 4,β-dihydroxyphenethylamine, is a [substituted phenethylamine](/wiki/Substituted_phenethylamine) [derivative](/wiki/Chemical_derivative).

A recent study showed that TAAR1 mediates AMPH-induced activation of the downstreaming RhoA and cAMP signaling in HEK293 cells expressing DAT but not cells without DAT (Underhill et al. 2019). Interestingly, two different G proteins G13 and Gs regulated TAAR1 activation (Underhill et al. 2019). It was further shown that AMPH induced activation of both TAAR1-G13-RhoA and TAAR1-Gs-PKA signaling were dependent on DAT (Underhill et al. 2019). However, the TAAR1 agonist octopamine, which is not a substrate of DAT, did not activate RhoA signaling. Accordingly, it was suggested that these TAAR1/RhoA and TAAR1/PKA signaling pathways might be particular cascades that mediate the effects of amphetamines and could not generalize to other TAAR1 agonists (Underhill et al. 2019).\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-UnderhillHullihenChen2021_64-0)** Underhill SM, Hullihen PD, Chen J, Fenollar-Ferrer C, Rizzo MA, Ingram SL, et&#160;al.

Notably, the TAAR1 agonist octopamine (10 μM) did not activate RhoA in these cells (Fig. 1c). Octopamine is a potent activator of TAAR1 [4, 5] however, it is a poor substrate for DAT [23]. Because the DAT dependence of the effects of TAAR1 agonists on RhoA activation suggests that TAAR1 agonists act intracellularly to stimulate the receptor, we permeablized the HEK293 cells with streptolysin O to allow octopamine access to the cytoplasm [24]. In the presence of streptolysin O, octopamine produces an approximately twofold increase in activated Rho, whereas streptolysin O had no effect on its own, demonstrating that a TAAR1 agonist that is not a substrate for DAT can activate Rho-dependent signaling once it enters the cell. These studies also imply that entry through the DAT may not be prerequisite for activation of intracellular signaling by TAAR1; in fact, two recently-developed compounds from Roche (RO5166017 and RO5203648) show TAAR1 agonist activity in DAT KO mice and thus may gain access to the cell interior via other avenues [25, 26].\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-PörzgenParkHirsh2001_65-0)** Pörzgen P, Park SK, Hirsh J, Sonders MS, Amara SG (January 2001). \"The antidepressant-sensitive dopamine transporter in Drosophila melanogaster: a primordial carrier for catecholamines\". *Mol Pharmacol*. **59** (1): 83–95.

          "abstract": "Pesticides have been used for many years for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating pests such as insects, rodents, and weeds. However, most pesticides are not completely specific for pests and can also induce damage to the human nervous system. In particular, insecticides often directly targets the nervous system by affecting major targets such as the neuro-transmitter metabolism, neuronal receptors, and ion channels; acetylcholine (ACh) esterase for organo-phosphates and carbamates, nicotinic ACh receptor for neonicotinoids, &#x3b3;-aminobutyric acid receptors/chloride channels for organochlorides and fipronil, and voltage-gated sodium channel for pyrethroids. Additional targets include sites in the sodium channels, glutamate-gated chloride channels, and octopamine and ryanodine receptors. Several pesticides also produce adverse neurological effects indirectly by disrupting the general cellular mechanisms that support the high metabolic activity of the nervous system. Nowadays, more potent pesticides are being developed as replacements for the older, harmful ones. Pesticide neurotoxicity in humans may involve the central or peripheral nervous system or both and may induce typical neuronal damage in case of acute poisoning even by new agents. However, whether effect of exposure to pesticides at below acute-poisoning threshold level remains unclear. Moreover, neurotoxicology for behavioral and higher-brain function remains an unresolved and a challenging problem.",

This review summarizes the chemistry, metabolism, receptor binding characteristics, known physiological functions, and pharmacological and toxicological effects of p-octopamine. Databases used included PubMed and Google Scholar Advanced. p-Octopamine binds to neuroreceptors in insects that are not present in humans, while exhibiting poor binding to &#x3b1;-1, &#x3b1;-2, &#x3b2;-1, and &#x3b2;-2 adrenergic receptors in mammalian systems. p-Octopamine modestly binds to &#x3b2;-3 adrenergic receptors and may therefore promote lipolysis and weight loss. p-Octopamine is produced in brain and nerve tissues of mammals and is present and can be measured in the blood of normal human subjects. p-Octopamine is considered to be a CNS stimulant in spite of the fact that it binds poorly to adrenergic receptors. Variations occur in blood levels in association with neurological and hepatic diseases. Its precise role in normal neurophysiology is unclear. No human studies have been reported that demonstrate adverse cardiovascular effects following oral administration. No human studies have examined the effects of p-octopamine on athletic performance or weight loss and weight management. A need exists for both animal and human safety and efficacy studies involving oral administration of p-octopamine.",

These chemists found that 600 g of barley, after germination and 10-day growth, yielded 168&#160;mg of N-methyltyramine. Since barley, via its conversion to malt, is used extensively in the production of beer, beer and malt have been examined by several groups of investigators for the presence of NMT. Citing a 1965 study by McFarlane, Poocharoen reported that beer contained ~ 5–8&#160;mg/L of NMT. The NMT content of various malts and malt fractions was extensively studied by Poocharoen himself, who also provided a good coverage of related literature up to 1983. This researcher found a mean concentration of NMT in raw barley of ~ 5 μg/g; in green malts (i.e. barley that had been soaked in water for 2 days then germinated for 4 days), the mean concentration was ~ 21 μg/g, and in kilned malts (i.e. green malts that had been heated in a kiln for 1–2 days) the mean concentration was ~ 27 μg/g. When only green malt roots were examined, their mean content of NMT was ~ 1530 μg/g, whereas the mean level in kilned malt roots was ~ 1960 μg/g. </p><p>Studies of <i>Acacia</i> species have shown the presence of significant levels of NMT in their leaves: ~ 240-1240 ppm (or μg/g) in <i>A. rigidula</i> and ~ 190-750 ppm in <i>A. berlandieri</i>. The seeds of <i>A. schweinfurthii</i> yielded 440 μg/g of NMT. </p><p>NMT is found in bitter orange, <i>Citrus aurantium</i>, and a concentration of ~ 180 μg/g has been reported from an extract made from the ripe fruit, although the method by which this extract was prepared is not very clearly described. </p> <p>NMT has been synthesized in a number of ways. One of the earliest syntheses is that reported by Walpole, who made it by the following sequence of steps: (i) acetylation of 4-methoxyphenethylamine with acetic anhydride; (ii) methylation of the amide using Na/methyl iodide; (iii) cleavage of the methyl ether to the phenol using HI; (iv) hydrolysis of the N-acetyl group with aqueous HCl. Walpole also described an alternative, but similar sequence of reactions leading to NMT, beginning with the conversion of 4-methoxyphenethylamine to its benzenesulfonamide, which was then N-methylated and de-protected. </p><p>A different method for making NMT was given by Corti, who prepared it by the thermal decarboxylation of <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=N-methyltyrosine&action=edit&redlink=1\" title=\"N-methyltyrosine (page does not exist)\">N-methyltyrosine</a> (ratanhin), by heating the amino-acid in fluorene at 250&#160;°C. Although N-methyltyrosine occurs naturally, it was made by the methylation of tyrosine using dimethyl sulfate. </p><p>NMT was also made by Kirkwood and Marion starting from 4-methoxyphenethylamine, but this was first converted to the imine with benzaldehyde, followed by methylation with dimethyl sulfate; the product was converted to N-methyl-4-methoxyphenethylamine, and finally de-O-methylated with HBr to give N-methyltyramine. </p> <p><i>N</i>-methyltyramine hydrochloride, C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>13</sub>NO.HCl: m.p.&#160;148.5&#160;°C; highly soluble in water and in ethanol. </p><p><i>N</i>-methyltyramine hydrogen oxalate, C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>13</sub>NO.C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>: m.p.&#160;250&#160;°C; very poorly soluble in water. </p> <p>The apparent (see original article for discussion) pK<sub>a</sub>s for protonated <i>N</i>-methyltyramine are 9.76 (phenolic H) and 10.71 (ammonium H). </p> <p>NMT is a pressor, with a potency of 1/140 × epinephrine. On the basis of experiments using dogs, Hjort described NMT as a \"very good pressor agent\": a blood pressure rise of &gt;130&#160;mm and ~ 5 minutes duration was produced by the injection of 1-2.5 μM of solutions of the HCl salt into dogs weighing ~ 10&#160;kg. A pressor response, which was inhibited by pre-treatment with reserpine, to the administration of NMT to goats was reported by Camp. </p><p>Subcutaneous administration of 10&#160;mg/kg of the HCl salt of NMT to mice enhanced the release of norepinephrine (NE) from the heart by 36% over control, measured after 2 hours. For comparison, the same dose of tyramine hydrochloride caused a release of NE of 50% over control in this assay. A qualitatively similar decrease in the NE content of rat heart after treatment with NMT was observed by Camp. </p><p>Without giving many experimental details, Evans et al. reported that NMT increased blood pressure in rats, inhibited electrically-induced contractions of the guinea-pig ileum, relaxed acetylcholine-stimulated tone of isolated guinea-pig trachealis muscle, and increased the rate and contractile force of isolated guinea-pig atrium. The effect on blood pressure was competitively-antagonized by guanethidine, while the effects on the isolated atrium were inhibited by desipramine. Although doses were not given, NMT was described as being equipotent with tyramine on all tissues. It was also noted that the handling of NMT caused migraine headaches in one of the researchers. </p><p>NMT has been found to be a potent stimulant of gastrin release in the rat, with an [[ED<sub>50</sub>]] of ~ 10 μg/kg. These researchers used a bio-assay-guided isolation procedure to show that NMT was the constituent of beer that was responsible for producing enhanced gastrin release, which in turn raises gastric acid secretion. For comparative purposes, they also tested tyramine and N,N-dimethyltyramine (hordenine) in their assay, finding that 83 nM/kg (corresponding to 12.5 μg/kg of NMT) of each compound enhanced gastrin release by ~ 58% for NMT, ~ 24% for tyramine, and ~ 60% for hordenine. </p><p>In order to test the indications from earlier studies that, like tyramine itself, NMT produced most of its pharmacological effects by stimulating norepinephrine (NE) release, Koda and co-workers investigated the action of NMT on α<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptors, which are involved in the regulation of NE. These researchers found that NMT competed with the binding of [H]-<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=P-aminoclonidine&action=edit&redlink=1\" title=\"P-aminoclonidine (page does not exist)\">p-aminoclonidine</a> to α<sub>2</sub> receptors from rat brain with an IC<sub>50</sub> of ~5.5 x 10M. In common with other α<sub>2</sub> antagonists, NMT, at i.p. doses of 20 or 100&#160;mg/kg, was also found to inhibit the hypermotility induced in mice by (−)-scopolamine in a dose-dependent manner. The same doses of NMT in the absence of scopolamine had no significant effects on locomotor activity in mice. </p><p>Since NMT is one of the constituents of bitter orange, <i>Citrus aurantium</i>, Mercader and co-workers studied its effects on lipolysis, finding that it <i>inhibited</i> lipolysis in rats. NMT (in common with tyramine) also failed to stimulate lipolysis in human adipocytes at a concentration of 10 μg/mL (i.e. ~ 66 μM/L); even at ≥ 100 μg/mL, NMT and tyramine induced only 20% of the lipolysis produced by the reference standard drug, isoprenaline. </p><p>NMT is a competitive substrate for MAO. </p><p>It is known to be a stimulator of pancreatic secretions in rats. </p><p>NMT has been shown to be an agonist of the TAAR1, similarly to its parent compound tyramine. The EC<sub>50</sub> of NMT on the human TAAR1 receptor was ~ 2 μM, compared to ~ 1 μM for tyramine. </p> <p>The pharmacokinetics of NMT have been studied in rabbits and mice using drug that had been radiolabeled with tritium at C-3 and C-5 on the benzene ring. Plasma concentrations were measured in the rabbits, whereas distribution, metabolism and excretion were determined in the mice. After i.v. administration to rabbits, the α-phase T<sub>1/2</sub> was found to be 0.3 minutes, and the β-phase T<sub>1/2</sub> was 5.6 minutes. These figures were indicative of a rapid distribution from blood to tissue and a very short plasma half-life. Within 2 minutes of injection, significant levels of radioactivity were detected in all tissues examined, with the highest amounts being in kidney and liver. No detectable radioactivity was left in the plasma after 30 minutes. Some NMT was found in the brains of mice treated with the drug, indicating that a small amount did cross the blood–brain barrier. ~ 80% of the administered dose was recovered from the urine of mice within 1 hour. </p> <p>LD<sub>50</sub> of HCl salt of NMT (mouse; i.p.) = 227&#160;mg/kg. Another acute toxicity study of NMT (under the Sterling-Winthrop company code \"WIN 5582\") found it to have an LD<sub>50</sub> = 275&#160;mg/kg, after intravenous administration to mice. </p> <ul><li>Tyramine</li> <li>Octopamine</li> <li>Epinine</li> <li>N-Methylphenethylamine</li> <li>Hordenine</li> <li>Candicine</li></ul> <div><ol> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Trace_amine_template_1_1-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Trace_amine_template_1_1-1\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Trace_amine_template_1_1-2\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Trace_amine_template_1_1-3\"></a> <cite >Broadley KJ (March 2010). \"The vascular effects of trace amines and amphetamines\". <i>Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics</i>. <b>125</b> (3): 363–375. doi:<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.pharmthera.2009.11.005\">10.1016/j.pharmthera.2009.11.005</a>.

Biosynthetically, NMT is produced by the N-[methylation](/wiki/Methylation) of tyramine via the action of the enzyme [phenylethanolamine *N*-methyltransferase](/wiki/Phenylethanolamine_N-methyltransferase) in humans[[1]](#cite_note-Trace_amine_template_1-1)[[2]](#cite_note-Trace_amine_template_2-2) and [tyramine *N*-methyltransferase](/wiki/Tyramine_N-methyltransferase) in plants.[[4]](#cite_note-4)\n\nN-methyltyramine seems to be quite widely distributed in plants.[[3]](#cite_note-Smith_1997-3)[[5]](#cite_note-Wheaton_1970-5)\nNMT was isolated as a [natural product](/wiki/Natural_product) for the first time, from germinating [barley](/wiki/Barley) roots, by Kirkwood and Marion in 1950. These chemists found that 600 g of barley, after germination and 10-day growth, yielded 168&#160;mg of N-methyltyramine.[[6]](#cite_note-Kirk-6) Since barley, via its conversion to [malt](/wiki/Malt), is used extensively in the production of [beer](/wiki/Beer), beer and malt have been examined by several groups of investigators for the presence of NMT. Citing a 1965 study by McFarlane,[[7]](#cite_note-7) Poocharoen reported that beer contained ~ 5–8&#160;mg/L of NMT.[[8]](#cite_note-Poocharoen_1983-8) The NMT content of various malts and malt fractions was extensively studied by Poocharoen himself, who also provided a good coverage of related literature up to 1983. This researcher found a mean concentration of NMT in raw barley[[9]](#cite_note-9) of ~ 5 μg/g; in green malts (i.e. barley that had been soaked in water for 2 days then germinated for 4 days), the mean concentration was ~ 21 μg/g, and in kilned malts (i.e. green malts that had been heated in a kiln for 1–2 days) the mean concentration was ~ 27 μg/g. When only green malt roots were examined, their mean content of NMT was ~ 1530 μg/g, whereas the mean level in kilned malt roots was ~ 1960 μg/g.[[8]](#cite_note-Poocharoen_1983-8)\nStudies of *[Acacia](/wiki/Acacia)* species have shown the presence of significant levels of NMT in their leaves: ~ 240-1240 ppm (or μg/g) in *[A. rigidula](/wiki/Acacia_rigidula)*[[10]](#cite_note-10) and ~ 190-750 ppm in *[A. berlandieri](/wiki/Acacia_berlandieri)*.[[11]](#cite_note-11) The seeds of *A. schweinfurthii* yielded 440 μg/g of NMT.[[12]](#cite_note-Evans_1979-12)\nNMT is found in [bitter orange](/wiki/Bitter_orange), *Citrus aurantium*, and a concentration of ~ 180 μg/g has been reported from an extract made from the ripe fruit, although the method by which this extract was prepared is not very clearly described.[[13]](#cite_note-Nelson_2007-13)\n\nNMT has been synthesized in a number of ways. One of the earliest syntheses is that reported by Walpole, who made it by the following sequence of steps: (i) acetylation of [4-methoxyphenethylamine](/wiki/4-methoxyphenethylamine) with acetic anhydride; (ii) methylation of the amide using Na/methyl iodide; (iii) cleavage of the methyl ether to the phenol using HI; (iv) hydrolysis of the N-acetyl group with aqueous HCl. Walpole also described an alternative, but similar sequence of reactions leading to NMT, beginning with the conversion of 4-methoxyphenethylamine to its benzenesulfonamide, which was then N-methylated and de-protected.[[15]](#cite_note-Walpole-15)\nA different method for making NMT was given by Corti, who prepared it by the thermal decarboxylation of [N-methyltyrosine](/w/index.php?title=N-methyltyrosine&action=edit&redlink=1) (ratanhin), by heating the amino-acid in [fluorene](/wiki/Fluorene) at 250&#160;°C. Although N-methyltyrosine occurs naturally, it was made by the methylation of [tyrosine](/wiki/Tyrosine) using dimethyl sulfate.[[16]](#cite_note-16)\nNMT was also made by Kirkwood and Marion starting from 4-methoxyphenethylamine, but this was first converted to the [imine](/wiki/Imine) with benzaldehyde, followed by methylation with [dimethyl sulfate](/wiki/Dimethyl_sulfate); the product was converted to N-methyl-4-methoxyphenethylamine, and finally de-O-methylated with HBr to give N-methyltyramine.[[6]](#cite_note-Kirk-6)\n\n*N*-methyltyramine hydrochloride, C9H13NO.HCl: m.p.&#160;148.5&#160;°C; highly soluble in water and in ethanol.[[15]](#cite_note-Walpole-15)\n*N*-methyltyramine hydrogen oxalate, C9H13NO.C2H2O4: m.p.&#160;250&#160;°C; very poorly soluble in water.[[15]](#cite_note-Walpole-15)\n\nThe apparent (see original article for discussion) pKas for protonated *N*-methyltyramine are 9.76 (phenolic H) and 10.71 (ammonium H).[[17]](#cite_note-pmid14323148-17)\n\nNMT is a [pressor](/wiki/Pressor), with a potency of 1/140 × [epinephrine](/wiki/Epinephrine).[[18]](#cite_note-Hart-18)\nOn the basis of experiments using dogs, Hjort described NMT as a \"very good pressor agent\": a blood pressure rise of >130&#160;mm and ~ 5 minutes duration was produced by the injection of 1-2.5 μM of solutions of the HCl salt into dogs weighing ~ 10&#160;kg.[[19]](#cite_note-19)\nA pressor response, which was inhibited by pre-treatment with [reserpine](/wiki/Reserpine), to the administration of NMT to goats was reported by Camp.[[20]](#cite_note-Camp-20)\nSubcutaneous administration of 10&#160;mg/kg of the HCl salt of NMT to mice enhanced the release of [norepinephrine](/wiki/Norepinephrine) (NE) from the heart by 36% over control, measured after 2 hours. For comparison, the same dose of [tyramine](/wiki/Tyramine) hydrochloride caused a release of NE of 50% over control in this assay.[[21]](#cite_note-Daly_1966-21) A qualitatively similar decrease in the NE content of rat heart after treatment with NMT was observed by Camp.[[20]](#cite_note-Camp-20)\nWithout giving many experimental details, Evans et al. reported that NMT increased blood pressure in rats, inhibited electrically-induced contractions of the guinea-pig ileum, relaxed [acetylcholine](/wiki/Acetylcholine)-stimulated tone of isolated guinea-pig [trachealis](/wiki/Trachealis) muscle, and increased the rate and contractile force of isolated guinea-pig atrium. The effect on blood pressure was competitively-antagonized by [guanethidine](/wiki/Guanethidine), while the effects on the isolated atrium were inhibited by [desipramine](/wiki/Desipramine). Although doses were not given, NMT was described as being equipotent with tyramine on all tissues. It was also noted that the handling of NMT caused [migraine](/wiki/Migraine) headaches in one of the researchers.[[12]](#cite_note-Evans_1979-12)\nNMT has been found to be a potent stimulant of [gastrin](/wiki/Gastrin) release in the rat, with an [[ED50]] of ~ 10 μg/kg.[[22]](#cite_note-pmid10344776-22) These researchers used a bio-assay-guided isolation procedure to show that NMT was the constituent of beer that was responsible for producing enhanced gastrin release, which in turn raises [gastric acid](/wiki/Gastric_acid) secretion. For comparative purposes, they also tested tyramine and N,N-dimethyltyramine ([hordenine](/wiki/Hordenine)) in their assay, finding that 83 nM/kg (corresponding to 12.5 μg/kg of NMT) of each compound enhanced gastrin release by ~ 58% for NMT, ~ 24% for tyramine, and ~ 60% for hordenine.\nIn order to test the indications from earlier studies that, like tyramine itself, NMT produced most of its pharmacological effects by stimulating [norepinephrine](/wiki/Norepinephrine) (NE) release, Koda and co-workers investigated the action of NMT on α2 [adrenoceptors](/wiki/Adrenoceptors), which are involved in the regulation of NE. These researchers found that NMT competed with the binding of [3H]-[p-aminoclonidine](/w/index.php?title=P-aminoclonidine&action=edit&redlink=1) to α2 receptors from rat brain with an IC50 of ~5.5 x 10−6M. In common with other α2 antagonists, NMT, at i.p. doses of 20 or 100&#160;mg/kg, was also found to inhibit the [hypermotility](/wiki/Hypermotility) induced in mice by (−)-[scopolamine](/wiki/Hyoscine_hydrobromide) in a dose-dependent manner. The same doses of NMT in the absence of scopolamine had no significant effects on [locomotor](/wiki/Animal_locomotion) activity in mice.[[23]](#cite_note-Koda_1999-23)\nSince NMT is one of the constituents of bitter orange, *[Citrus aurantium](/wiki/Citrus_aurantium)*, Mercader and co-workers studied its effects on [lipolysis](/wiki/Lipolysis), finding that it *inhibited* lipolysis in rats. NMT (in common with tyramine) also failed to stimulate lipolysis in human [adipocytes](/wiki/Adipocytes) at a concentration of 10 μg/mL (i.e. ~ 66 μM/L); even at ≥ 100 μg/mL, NMT and tyramine induced only 20% of the lipolysis produced by the reference standard drug, [isoprenaline](/wiki/Isoprenaline).[[24]](#cite_note-Mercader_2011-24)\nNMT is a competitive substrate for [MAO](/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase).[[25]](#cite_note-Kemmerling_1996-25)\nIt is known to be a stimulator of [pancreatic secretions](/wiki/Pancreatic_juice) in rats.[[26]](#cite_note-26)\nNMT has been shown to be an [agonist](/wiki/Agonist) of the [TAAR1](/wiki/Trace_amine-associated_receptor_1), similarly to its parent compound [tyramine](/wiki/Tyramine).[[27]](#cite_note-Lindemann_2005a-27) The EC50 of NMT on the human TAAR1 receptor was ~ 2 μM, compared to ~ 1 μM for [tyramine](/wiki/Tyramine).[[28]](#cite_note-Lindemann_2005b-28)\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of NMT have been studied in rabbits and mice using drug that had been [radiolabeled](/wiki/Radiolabeled) with [tritium](/wiki/Tritium) at C-3 and C-5 on the benzene ring. Plasma concentrations were measured in the rabbits, whereas distribution, metabolism and excretion were determined in the mice. After i.v. administration to rabbits, the α-phase T1/2 was found to be 0.3 minutes, and the β-phase T1/2 was 5.6 minutes. These figures were indicative of a rapid distribution from blood to tissue and a very short plasma half-life. Within 2 minutes of injection, significant levels of [radioactivity](/wiki/Radioactivity) were detected in all tissues examined, with the highest amounts being in kidney and liver. No detectable radioactivity was left in the plasma after 30 minutes. Some NMT was found in the brains of mice treated with the drug, indicating that a small amount did cross the [blood–brain barrier](/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier). ~ 80% of the administered dose was recovered from the urine of mice within 1 hour.[[29]](#cite_note-29)\n\nLD50 of HCl salt of NMT (mouse; i.p.) = 227&#160;mg/kg.[[18]](#cite_note-Hart-18) Another acute toxicity study of NMT (under the Sterling-Winthrop company code \"WIN 5582\") found it to have an LD50 = 275&#160;mg/kg, after intravenous administration to mice.[[30]](#cite_note-pmid13000630-30)\n\n- [Tyramine](/wiki/Tyramine)\n\n- [Octopamine](/wiki/Octopamine)\n\n- [Epinine](/wiki/Epinine)\n\n- [N-Methylphenethylamine](/wiki/N-Methylphenethylamine)\n\n- [Hordenine](/wiki/Hordenine)\n\n- [Candicine](/wiki/Candicine)\n\n^ [***a***](#cite_ref-Trace_amine_template_1_1-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-Trace_amine_template_1_1-1) [***c***](#cite_ref-Trace_amine_template_1_1-2) [***d***](#cite_ref-Trace_amine_template_1_1-3) Broadley KJ (March 2010). \"The vascular effects of trace amines and amphetamines\". *Pharmacology & Therapeutics*. **125** (3): 363–375.

          "abstract": "Feeding experiments carried out with cattle and horses could prove the toxic effects of P. marcgravii (Rubiaceae) in all cases. The typical symptoms of \"sudden death\", however, are observed in ruminants only. This difference could not be explained so far. Apart from fluoroacetate, two more substances also have influence the toxic effects and have been isolated from P. marcgravii for the first time: N-methyltyramine and 2-methyltetrahydro-beta-carboline (2-Me THBC). Structure elucidation of these compounds is mainly accomplished by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and MS techniques. Due to the small quantity of fluoroacetate (5.4 micrograms/g plant), the main toxic effect obviously lies in the two discovered substances. In contrast to the slow death of horses (monogastriers), the \"sudden death syndrome\" of cattle (ruminants) can be explained as a result of the higher resorbility of these two substances in the gastro-intestinal system. Given orally, both substances influence the monoamine oxidase type A (MAO-A): N-methyltyramine acts as a competitive substrate, and 2-Me THBC is one of the most effective MAO-A-inhibitors. Thus, the decomposition of the specific MAO-A-substrates noradrenaline and adrenaline as well as of N-methyltyramine itself is inhibited. The alpha- and beta-receptors of the sympathetic system are stimulated more strongly, which leads to a drastic rise in blood pressure and thereby to a more rapid distribution of fluoroacetate in the body. This results in a reinforced input of fluoroacetate in the cells of especially active organs of the body (heart etc.). Thus, even smaller quantities of fluoroacetate are lethal.",

          "abstract": "Citrus aurantium (bitter orange) is a plant belonging to the family Rutaceae, whose fruit extracts have been used recently for the treatment of obesity. The most important biologically active constituents of the C. aurantium fruits are phenethylamine alkaloids (i.e. octopamine, synephrine, tyramine, N-methyltyramine and hordenine). Synephrine is a primary synthesis compound with pharmacological activities such as vasoconstriction, elevation of blood pressure and relaxation of bronchial muscle. Synephrine is present in the peel and the edible part of Citrus fruit. Of the adrenergic amines of natural origin, synephrine has been found to be the main constituent of C. aurantium fruits and extracts; the other alkaloids are either absent or present in only low concentrations. It is known that synephrine and the other amines found in C. aurantium have adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, owing to adrenergic stimulation. In light of the great commercial proliferation of C. aurantium herbal medicines in recent years, this review provides an overview of various extraction, separation and detection techniques employed for the qualitative and quantitative determination of the alkaloids in C. aurantium and related species. The application of chromatographic and electrophoretic methods for the separation and determination of these active components in C. aurantium plant material and derivatives are described. Since synephrine is a chiral compound, enantioselective chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques for the analysis of synephrine enantiomers in natural products are presented. Furthermore, examples of identification of these active compounds in complex matrices by hyphenated methods, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, are described. The advantages and limitations of these separation and identification methods are assessed and discussed.",

names <b>Arcalion</b>, <b>Enerion</b>, and <b>Sulbuxin</b> is a synthetic derivative of thiamine (vitamin B<sub>1</sub>). In France, it is used to treat symptoms of weakness or fatigue. In Uruguay, it is prescribed when there is thiamine deficiency, mainly in patients with asthenia, overwork, apathy, depressive states, memory disorders, and iatrogenic disorders of wakefulness. It is also sold as a dietary supplement. Sulbutiamine was discovered in Japan as part of an effort to develop useful thiamine derivatives. </p> <meta property=\"mw:PageProp/toc\"> <p>Sulbutiamine is used to treat asthenia (weakness), though is not clear if it is effective in alleviating drowsiness. It is also used to treat thiamine deficiency and poor concentration. Being a potent cholinergic, sulbutiamine is a popular nootropic, with users reporting enhanced memory, focus, and improved mood and motivation. Endurance athletes may use it to try to enhance their performance. </p> <p>Adverse effects found in clinical trials are usually limited to headache and gastrointestinal discomfort when high doses are used. While daily use can result in tolerance and paradoxical drowsiness, increasing the dose is strongly discouraged and side effects can include diarrhea, bladder infections, bronchitis, back pain, abdominal pain, insomnia, constipation, gastroenteritis, headache, vertigo, and sore throat. </p> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Thiamin.svg\"><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Thiamin.svg/250px-Thiamin.svg.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"200\" height=\"116\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Thiamin.svg/330px-Thiamin.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Thiamin.svg/400px-Thiamin.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"346\" data-file-height=\"201\"></a><figcaption>Thiamine</figcaption></figure> <p>Efforts to develop thiamine derivatives with better bioavailability than thiamine were conducted in the 1950s, mainly in Japan. These efforts led to the discovery of allicin (diallyl thiosulfinate) in garlic, which became a model for medicinal chemistry efforts to create other thiamine disulfides. The results included sulbutiamine, fursultiamine (thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide) and benfotiamine. These compounds are hydrophobic, easily pass from the intestines to the bloodstream, and are reduced to thiamine by cysteine or glutathione. </p><p>It was first marketed in France by Servier in 1973 under the brand name Arcalion. The drug registration went through a validation procedure in France in the 1980s, which found that the use for treatment of fatigue was not supported by data. In January 1989, 100 mg tablet doses were discontinued in favour of 200 mg tablets. </p> <p>Because thiamine deficiency causes problems with memory and other cognitive functions, thiamine and analogs like sulbutiamine have been studied in clinical trials in the 1980s and 1990s for age-associated cognitive decline. </p><p>Sulbutiamine has been explored in clinical trials as a potential treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Studies have also been undertaken to assess its impact on reversing age-related changes in the circadian system. </p><p>The pharmacology of sulbutiamine has been studied in various mice and rats; as of 2014 it appeared that sulbutiamine might be more effective in raising thiamine phosphate levels in the brain than benfotiamine and fursultiamine, but this has not been fully verified. University of Oxford studies indicate that it helps prevent apoptotic cell death, caused by trophic factor deprivation, in retinal ganglion cells. </p><p>In an uncontrollled clinical trial, sulbutiamine was reported to be effective in reducing fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis. </p> <ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Vitamin_B1_analogue\" title=\"Vitamin B1 analogue\">Vitamin B<sub>1</sub> analogue</a></li> <li>Pyritinol</li></ul> <div><ol> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b> <cite><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vademecum.es/uruguay/medicamento/1459941/sulbuxin-200-mg-comprimido-recubierto\">\"Ficha de sulbuxin 200 mg comprimido recubierto de Uruguay 🥇\"</a>. <i>www.vademecum.es</i>.</cite></span> </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-FrenchDrugDatabase_2-0\">^</a></b> <cite><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://base-donnees-publique.medicaments.gouv.fr/extrait.php?specid=64384738\">\"Fiche info - Araclion 200 mg\"</a> (in French).

When one stem ceases growing, new shoots arise from the base. This cycle continues, forming a clump of stems. Its inflorescence is erect, with blooms forming along the length of the flowering stem. It has strap-shaped, persistent leaves and blooms mostly in winter and spring, producing short, 2 to 4-flowered racemes. The flowers are fragrant, waxy, and highly variable in color, ranging from white to pink and purple.

          "abstract": "Ferroptosis, a novel form of programmed cell death, is characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and has been shown to be involved in multiple diseases, including cancer. Stimulating ferroptosis in cancer cells may be a potential strategy for cancer therapy. Therefore, ferroptosis-inducing drugs are attracting more attention for cancer treatment. Here, we showed that erianin, a natural product isolated from Dendrobium chrysotoxum Lindl, exerted its anticancer activity by inducing cell death and inhibiting cell migration in lung cancer cells. Subsequently, we demonstrated for the first time that erianin induced ferroptotic cell death in lung cancer cells, which was accompanied by ROS accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and GSH depletion. The ferroptosis inhibitors Fer-1 and Lip-1 but not Z-VAD-FMK, CQ, or necrostatin-1 rescued erianin-induced cell death, indicating that ferroptosis contributed to erianin-induced cell death. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Ca2+/CaM signaling was a critical mediator of erianin-induced ferroptosis and that blockade of this signaling significantly rescued cell death induced by erianin treatment by suppressing ferroptosis. Taken together, our data suggest that the natural product erianin exerts its anticancer effects by inducing Ca2+/CaM-dependent ferroptosis and inhibiting cell migration, and erianin will hopefully serve as a prospective compound for lung cancer treatment.",

It is derived from stems of various Dendrobium plants and has the functions of nourishing Yin and clearing heat, activating water and nourishing the stomach, moistening the lung and relieving cough. Modern phytochemical studies show that the main components of Dendrobium include alkaloids, polysaccharides, terpenoids, diphenylbenzene, and phenanthrene. Alkaloids are natural products with obvious biological activity and are important effective components of the medicinal activity or toxicity of plants. At present, dozens of alkaloids with various structures have been isolated from Dendrobium plants, and the alkaloid contents in Dendrobium plants of different species are quite different. From the perspective of food safety, the type, molecular structure, content and potential physiological activity or toxicity of alkaloids are important bases for evaluating the safety of edible plants. Studies have shown that the alkaloids isolated from Dendrobium have neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities, showing that these alkaloids with potential medicinal activity are important sources of lead compounds in innovative drug development.",

          "abstract": "Polysaccharides, predominantly extracted from traditional Chinese medicinal herbs such as Lycium barbarum, Angelica sinensis, Astragalus membranaceus, Dendrobium officinale, Ganoderma lucidum, and Poria cocos, represent principal bioactive constituents extensively utilized in Chinese medicine. These compounds have demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory capabilities, especially anti-liver injury activities, while exhibiting minimal adverse effects. This review summarized recent studies to elucidate the hepatoprotective efficacy and underlying molecular mechanisms of these herbal polysaccharides. It underscored the role of these polysaccharides in regulating hepatic function, enhancing immunological responses, and improving antioxidant capacities, thus contributing to the attenuation of hepatocyte apoptosis and liver protection. Analyses of molecular pathways in these studies revealed the intricate and indispensable functions of traditional Chinese herbal polysaccharides in liver injury management. Therefore, this review provides a thorough examination of the hepatoprotective attributes and molecular mechanisms of these medicinal polysaccharides, thereby offering valuable insights for the advancement of polysaccharide-based therapeutic research and their potential clinical applications in liver disease treatment.",

Britton & Rose\n\n***Vachellia rigidula***, commonly known as **blackbrush acacia** or **chaparro prieto**, and also known as ***Acacia rigidula***, is a species of shrub or small tree in the [legume](/wiki/Legume) family, [Fabaceae](/wiki/Fabaceae). Its native range stretches from [Texas](/wiki/Texas) in the [United States](/wiki/United_States) south to central [Mexico](/wiki/Mexico).[[3]](#cite_note-GRIN-3) This perennial is not listed as being threatened.[[4]](#cite_note-4) It reaches a height of 5–15 feet (1.5–4.6&#160;m).[[5]](#cite_note-Wildflower-5)  Blackbrush acacia grows on [limestone](/wiki/Limestone) hillsides and canyons.[[6]](#cite_note-6)\n\nA phytochemical study of *V. rigidula*[[7]](#cite_note-7) by workers at the Texas A & M University Agricultural Research and Extension Center at Uvalde, TX, reported the presence of over forty [alkaloids](/wiki/Alkaloids), including  low amounts (up to around 15&#160;ppm) of several [phenolic amines](/w/index.php?title=Phenolic_amines&action=edit&redlink=1) that had previously been found by the same research group in the related species *[Senegalia berlandieri](/wiki/Senegalia_berlandieri)*,[[8]](#cite_note-8) but which otherwise are known only as products of laboratory synthesis. Compounds found in the highest concentrations (ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand ppm) were [phenethylamine](/wiki/Phenethylamine), [tryptamine](/wiki/Tryptamine), [tyramine](/wiki/Tyramine), and [β-Methylphenethylamine](/wiki/%CE%92-Methylphenethylamine) (that it can be misidentified as amphetamine).[[9]](#cite_note-9) Other notable compounds reported were [*N*,*N*-dimethyltryptamine](/wiki/N,N-dimethyltryptamine), [mescaline](/wiki/Mescaline), and [nicotine](/wiki/Nicotine), although these were found in low concentrations (e.g. mescaline at 3-28 ppm).\nThe presence of such an unprecedented chemical range of [psychoactive](/wiki/Psychoactive) compounds, including ones not previously found in nature, in a single plant species has led to the suggestion that some of these findings may have resulted from cross-contamination or were possibly artifacts of the analytical technique.[[10]](#cite_note-10)\n\n*Vachellia rigidula* is used in weight loss [dietary supplements](/wiki/Dietary_supplement) because of the presence of chemical compounds claimed to stimulate [beta-receptors](/wiki/Adrenergic_receptor) to increase [lipolysis](/wiki/Lipolysis) and metabolic rate and decrease appetite.[[11]](#cite_note-11)\n*Vachellia rigidula* is also known as a large honey producer and early blooming plant for its native region.[[5]](#cite_note-Wildflower-5)\n\nIn 2015, 52% of supplements labeled as containing *Acacia rigidula* were found to be adulterated with synthetic [BMPEA](/wiki/%CE%92-Methylphenethylamine), an [amphetamine](/wiki/Amphetamine) isomer.[[12]](#cite_note-cohen2015-12) Consumers following recommended maximum daily servings would consume a maximum of 94&#160;mg of BMPEA per day.[[12]](#cite_note-cohen2015-12) In 2012, however, the FDA determined that BMPEA was not naturally present in *Acacia rigidula* leaves.[[13]](#cite_note-13)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Acacia_rigidula_seeds.jpg/120px-Acacia_rigidula_seeds.jpg)](/wiki/File:Acacia_rigidula_seeds.jpg)\n\n\t\t\tSeeds\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Acacia-rigidula-branch.jpg/120px-Acacia-rigidula-branch.jpg)](/wiki/File:Acacia-rigidula-branch.jpg)\n\n\t\t\tFoliage\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Acacia-rigidula-bark.jpg/120px-Acacia-rigidula-bark.jpg)](/wiki/File:Acacia-rigidula-bark.jpg)\n\n\t\t\tBark\n\n\t\t\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-iucn_1-0)** Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) & IUCN SSC Global Tree Specialist Group 2019 (2019).

          "abstract": "Extracts of Acacia rigidula leaves are used in weight-loss products sold in vitamin shops and over the internet with little or no published data about their potential biological effects. In our chemical investigations on authenticated A. rigidula plant material, we established a rapid and sensitive LC-MS/MS method for the quantitative determination of several phenethylamine, tyramine and tryptamine derivatives. Stable isotopically labeled compounds were used as internal standards for quantitative analysis. We found total calculated contents of 6 biogenic amines in A. rigidula leaf of 18.6 and 32.9&#x3bc;g/g. The content of selected amines in 21 dietary supplements labeled as containing A. rigidula was determined by a second LC-MS/MS method. Our study revealed significant differences in the amine profiles of authenticated plant materials and dietary supplements. &#x3b2;-Methylphenethylamine, a non-natural compound, was found in 9 of the 21 dietary supplement products. &#x3b2;-Methylphenethylamine was found at levels of 960-60,500&#x3bc;g/g while phenethylamine was found at levels of 710-171,620&#x3bc;g/g. &#x3b2;-Methylphenethylamine is a positional isomer of amphetamine and our results showed that it can be misidentified as amphetamine during LC-MS analysis. An independent GC-MS analysis was used to confirm the presence of &#x3b2;-methylphenethylamine and the absence of amphetamine in dietary supplements labeled as containing A. rigidula. This study demonstrates that confirmations by independent analytical methods are essential to verify findings of unusual or unexpected compounds in dietary supplements.",

          "abstract": "The amphetamine isomer &#x3b2;-methylphenylethylamine (BMPEA) was first synthesized in the early 1930s, but its efficacy and safety in humans has not been studied. Recently, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) detected BMPEA in dietary supplements labelled as containing Acacia rigidula. Over a year after the FDA reported its findings, we analyzed Acacia rigidula dietary supplements to determine if BMPEA had been removed. Supplements were analyzed using liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Diluted methanolic extract from each supplement was run three times and each data set obtained was analyzed using Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Analysis. The presence of BMPEA was confirmed by accurate mass, retention time and mass spectra match against a reference standard. Quantification of BMPEA was determined using an eight-point calibration curve of spiked standard to a matrix blank. Twenty-one brands of Acacia rigidula supplements were analyzed. More than half (11/21; 52.4%) of the Acacia rigidula supplement brands contained BMPEA. The stimulant was present at quantities such that consumers following recommended maximum daily servings would consume a maximum of 93.7 mg of BMPEA per day. Consumers of Acacia rigidula supplements may be exposed to pharmacological dosages of an amphetamine isomer that lacks evidence of safety in humans. The FDA should immediately warn consumers about BMPEA and take aggressive enforcement action to eliminate BMPEA in dietary supplements. Copyright &#xa9; 2015 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

          "abstract": "One of the main issues in the medical field and clinical practice is the development of novel and effective treatments against infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. One avenue that has been approached to develop effective antimicrobials is the use of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs), since they have been found to exhibit an efficient and wide spectrum of antimicrobial properties. Among the main drawbacks of using Ag-NPs are their potential cytotoxicity against eukaryotic cells and the latent environmental toxicity of their synthesis methods. Therefore, diverse green synthesis methods, which involve the use of environmentally friendly plant extracts as reductive and capping agents, have become attractive to synthesize Ag-NPs that exhibit antimicrobial effects against resistant bacteria at concentrations below toxicity thresholds for eukaryotic cells.",

The practice of betel nut chewing, often together with other herbs as a stimulant drug, dates back thousands of years, and continues to the present day in many countries. </p><p>Betel nut chewing is addictive due to the presence of the stimulant arecoline and causes adverse health effects—mainly oral and esophageal cancers, as well as cardiovascular disease. When chewed with additional tobacco in its preparation (like in gutka), there is an even higher risk, especially for oral and oropharyngeal cancers. With tobacco it also raises the risk of fatal coronary artery disease, fatal stroke, and adverse reproductive effects, including stillbirth, premature birth, and low birth weight. </p><p>Consumption by hundreds of millions of people worldwide—mainly of South/Southeast Asian origin—has been described as a public health emergency. </p> <meta property=\"mw:PageProp/toc\"> <p>The term <i>areca</i> originated from Dravidian languages, cognates of which are: </p> <ul><li>Malayalam: അടയ്ക്ക, <small>romanized:&#160;</small><i lang=\"ml-Latn\">aṭaykka</i></li> <li>Kannada: ಅಡಿಕೆ, <small>romanized:&#160;</small><i lang=\"kn-Latn\">adike</i></li> <li>Tamil: அடைக்காய், <small>romanized:&#160;</small><i lang=\"ta-Latn\">aḍaikkāy</i></li></ul> <p>The terms dates back to the 16th century, when Dutch and Portuguese sailors took the nut from India to Europe. </p> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Areca_catechu_nuts_at_Kadavoor.jpg\"><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Areca_catechu_nuts_at_Kadavoor.jpg/250px-Areca_catechu_nuts_at_Kadavoor.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"250\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Areca_catechu_nuts_at_Kadavoor.jpg/500px-Areca_catechu_nuts_at_Kadavoor.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"2736\" data-file-height=\"3648\"></a><figcaption>Areca fruits on a tree</figcaption></figure> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Betel_nut_palms_in_Ponda,_Goa.jpeg\"><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Betel_nut_palms_in_Ponda%2C_Goa.jpeg/250px-Betel_nut_palms_in_Ponda%2C_Goa.jpeg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"250\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Betel_nut_palms_in_Ponda%2C_Goa.jpeg/500px-Betel_nut_palms_in_Ponda%2C_Goa.jpeg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"2000\" data-file-height=\"3552\"></a><figcaption>Areca nut palm plantation in Goa, India</figcaption></figure> <p>The areca nut is not a true nut, but rather the seed of a fruit categorized as a berry. It is commercially available in dried, cured, and fresh forms. When the husk of the fresh fruit is green, the nut inside is soft enough to be cut with a typical knife. In the ripe fruit, the husk becomes yellow or orange, and as it dries, the fruit inside hardens to a wood-like consistency. At that stage, the areca nut can only be sliced using a special scissors-like cutter. </p><p>Usually, for chewing, a few slices of the nut are wrapped in a betel leaf along with calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) and may include clove, cardamom, catechu resin (<i>kattha</i>), or other spices for extra flavouring. Betel leaf has a fresh, peppery taste, but it can also be bitter to varying degrees, depending on the variety. </p><p>Areca nuts are chewed for their effects as a mild stimulant, causing a warming sensation in the body and slightly heightened alertness, although the effects vary from person to person. </p><p>The first nut cultivation in the world was done in Kyasanuru Seeme area of Shimoga district in Karnataka state of India. Even today, the cultivators plant the same variety here. The Kyasanuru variety gives high yields and grows wild in all regions. </p><p>In parts of India, Sri Lanka, and southern China, areca nuts are not only chewed along with betel leaf, but are also used in the preparation of Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicines. Powdered areca nut is used as a constituent in some dentifrices. Other traditional uses include the removal of tapeworms and other intestinal parasites by swallowing a few teaspoons of powdered areca nut, drunk as a decoction, or by taking tablets containing the extracted alkaloids. According to traditional Ayurvedic medicine, chewing areca nut and betel leaf is a good remedy against bad breath. Diplomat Edmund Roberts noted that Chinese people would mix areca nut with <i>Uncaria gambir</i> during his visit to China in the 1830s. After chewing a betel nut, the red residue is generally spat out. Accordingly, places have banned chewing this nut to avoid eyesores. </p> <p>The major alkaloid in betel nut is arecoline. There are other compounds, such as arecaidine, guvacine, isoguvacine, and guvacoline. Tannins present in betel nut are mainly proanthocyanidins along with catechins and arecatannin. Two new alkaloids were recently discovered and named acatechu A and acatechu B. Several non-alkaloid compounds including benzenoids, terpenes, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, alcohols, and esters were also identified. </p> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Lao_woman_chewing_paan.jpg\"><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Lao_woman_chewing_paan.jpg/330px-Lao_woman_chewing_paan.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"290\" height=\"193\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Lao_woman_chewing_paan.jpg/500px-Lao_woman_chewing_paan.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Lao_woman_chewing_paan.jpg/960px-Lao_woman_chewing_paan.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"3242\" data-file-height=\"2161\"></a><figcaption>A woman with the characteristic red-stained teeth and gums from long term use.</figcaption></figure><p>Chewing areca nut increases the risk of multiple forms of cancer and cardiovascular disease, with or without added tobacco. </p><p>Betel nut chewing causes an increased risk of head and neck cancers and esophageal cancer.

It is available practically everywhere and is sold in ready-to-chew pouches called <i>pan masala</i> or <i>supari</i>, which is the dried form of the areca nut, as a mixture of many flavours whose primary base is dried areca nut crushed into small pieces. Poor people, who may eat only every other day, use it to stave off hunger pangs. <i>Pan masala</i> with a small quantity of tobacco is called <i>gutka</i>. The easily discarded, small plastic <i>supari</i> or <i>gutka</i> pouches are a ubiquitous pollutant of the South Asian environment. Some of the liquid in the mouth is usually disposed of by spitting, producing bright red spots wherever the expectorate lands. </p><p>In the Maldives, areca nut chewing is very popular, but spitting is frowned upon and regarded as an unrefined, repulsive way of chewing. Usually, people prefer to chew thin slices of the dry nut, which is sometimes roasted. <i>Killi</i>, a mixture of areca nut, betel, cloves, cardamom and sugar is sold in small home-made paper pouches. Old people who have lost their teeth keep \"chewing\" by pounding the mixture of areca nut and betel with a small mortar and pestle. </p> <p>In Thailand, the consumption of areca nut has declined gradually in the last decades. The younger generation rarely chews the substance, especially in the cities. Most of the present-day consumption is confined to older generations, mostly people above 50. Even so, small trays of betel leaves and sliced tender areca nut are sold in markets and used as offerings in Buddhist shrines. </p><p>In the northern Philippines, particularly the Cordillera Administrative Region, betel nut chewing remains prominent to the point that restrictions and fines have been established in urban areas such as Baguio City in the Benguet province. These restrictions were made under the idea that <i>momma</i> or <i>moma</i> (betel nut) chewing and spitting are improper during public transportation drivers' work hours and are considered stains to the city roads and sidewalks. Despite these restrictions, betel nut thrives across the Cordilleran market. An example of its commerciality can be observed in Ifugao, one of the provinces of the Philippine Cordilleras, where betel nuts are high-demand products sourced from the province's different cities and municipalities. </p><p>In Bahasa Indonesia, the betel nut is known as <i>makan pinang</i>, while in the Papua Province of Indonesia, it is known simply as <i>pinang</i>. The Pinang scissor was developed specifically for cutting it. </p> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Eating_Pinang_prohibited.jpg\"><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Eating_Pinang_prohibited.jpg/250px-Eating_Pinang_prohibited.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"250\" height=\"289\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Eating_Pinang_prohibited.jpg/375px-Eating_Pinang_prohibited.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Eating_Pinang_prohibited.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"398\" data-file-height=\"460\"></a><figcaption>Sign saying that chewing betel-nut is prohibited, at Sentani Airport, Jayapura, Papua Province, Indonesia</figcaption></figure> <p>In Papua New Guinea (PNG), betel nuts are referred to in Tok Pisin as <i>buai</i>, and grow abundantly on the northern coast, in Wewak and Madang. A controversial ban on selling and chewing betel nut in public places in Port Moresby, introduced in 2014 by the governor, was lifted in 2017. Because the popular nut continued to be smuggled in, prices rose dramatically. Police enforced the ban rigorously, and in 2015 two betel nut sellers died in Hanuabada after police reservists fired on a crowd. The governor of Port Moresby introduced another ban on the nut, restricted to an area in the business district of the city in July 2023. However many people make a living out of selling betel nut, so are resistant to bans in their areas. On Manus Island, young men are exposed to piracy when they use small boats to travel to the northern coast to purchase betel nuts to trade, and several have disappeared. </p><p>In Australia, the importation, use, and sale of areca nut is banned, but it has been sold illegally in several South Asian supermarkets. </p> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Areca_nuts_in_China_01.jpg\"><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Areca_nuts_in_China_01.jpg/250px-Areca_nuts_in_China_01.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"250\" height=\"141\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Areca_nuts_in_China_01.jpg/500px-Areca_nuts_in_China_01.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"806\" data-file-height=\"454\"></a><figcaption>Areca nuts as sold in Hainan, China</figcaption></figure> <p>In Hainan and Hunan Province, China, where Xiangtan is a center of use and processing, a wide range of old and young people consume areca nut daily. Most, though, consume the dried variety of the nut by itself, without the betel leaves. Some people also consume the areca nut in its raw, fresh form with or without the betel leaves. Betel nuts are sold mostly by old women merchants, but the dried version can be found in shops that sell tea, alcohol, and cigarettes. </p><p>In Taiwan, bags of 20 to 40 areca nuts are purchased fresh daily by a large number of consumers. To meet the steady year-round demand, two kinds of betel-nut shops sell betel and nuts, as well as cigarettes and drinks, including beer: small mom and pop shops, often poorly maintained and with unassuming façades, and shops which will often consist of nothing more than a single, free-standing room, or booth. The latter is usually elevated one meter above the street, and measures less than 3 by 2 m. Large picture windows comprise two or more of the walls, allowing those who pass by a complete view of the interior. The interior is often painted brightly. Within such a shop, a sexily dressed young woman, a \"betel nut beauty\", can be seen preparing betel and areca nuts. Shops are often identified by colorful (commonly green) LED lamps or neon lights that frame the windows or that are arranged radially above a store. Customers stop on the side of the road and wait for the girls to bring their betel and areca nut to their vehicles. The habit of chewing betel nut is often associated with blue-collar labor industries such as long-haul transportation, construction, or fishing. Workers in these labor-intensive industries use betel nut for its stimulating effect, but it also becomes a tool for socializing with coworkers. For example, studies have shown chewing betel nut is prevalent among taxi, bus and truck drivers, who rely on the stimulating effect of betel nut to cope with long work hours. For these reasons, oral cancer has been identified as a leading cause of death in professions with high betel nut-chewing rates. </p> <p>In the United States, areca nut is not a controlled or specially taxed substance and may be found in some Asian grocery stores. However, importation of areca nut in a form other than whole or carved kernels of nuts can be stopped at the discretion of US Customs officers on the grounds of food, agricultural, or medicinal drug violations. </p><p>In the United Kingdom the betel nut is legal. </p><p>Possession of areca nut or betel leaf is banned in the UAE and is a punishable offence. </p> <div><h3 >Traditional consumption</h3><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Areca_nut&action=edit&section=14\" title=\"Edit section: Traditional consumption\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Paan60.jpg\"><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Paan60.jpg/250px-Paan60.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"250\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Paan60.jpg/500px-Paan60.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"670\" data-file-height=\"610\"></a><figcaption>Display of the items usually included in a chewing session: The betel leaves are folded, with slices of the dry areca nut on the upper left hand and slices of the tender areca nut on the upper right.

Why or when the areca nut and the betel leaf were first combined into one psychoactive drug is not known. Archaeological evidence from Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines suggests they have been used in tandem for at least 4,000 years. </p><p>The oldest unequivocal evidence of betel chewing is from the Philippines, specifically that of several individuals found in a burial pit in the Duyong Cave site of Palawan island dated to around 2680±250 BCE. The dentition of the skeletons is stained, typical of betel chewers. The grave also includes <i>Anadara</i> shells used as containers of lime, one of which still contained lime. Burial sites in Bohol dated to the first millennium CE also show the distinctive reddish stains characteristic of betel chewing. Based on linguistic evidence of how the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian term <i>*buaq</i> originally meaning \"fruit\" came to refer to \"areca nut\" in Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, it is believed that betel chewing originally developed somewhere within the Philippines shortly after the beginning of the Austronesian expansion (~3000 BCE). From the Philippines, it spread back to Taiwan, as well as onwards to the rest of Austronesia and in neighboring cultures through trade and migration. </p><p>In Vietnam, the areca nut and the betel leaf are such important symbols of love and marriage that in Vietnamese the phrase \"matters of betel and areca\" (<i>chuyện trầu cau</i>) is synonymous with marriage. The tradition of chewing areca nuts starts the talk between the groom's parents and the bride's parents about the young couple's marriage. Therefore, the leaves and juices are used ceremonially in Vietnamese weddings. The folk tale explaining the origin of this Vietnamese tradition is a good illustration of the belief that the combination of areca nut and the betel leaf is ideal to the point they are practically inseparable, like an idealized married couple. </p><p>Formerly, in both India and Sri Lanka, it was a custom of the royalty to chew areca nut with betel leaf. Kings had special attendants whose duty it was to carry a box with all the necessary ingredients for a good chewing session. There was also a custom for lovers to chew areca nut and betel leaf together, because of its breath-freshening and relaxant properties. A sexual symbolism thus became attached to the chewing of the nut and the leaf. The areca nut represented the male principle, and the betel leaf the female principle. Considered an auspicious ingredient in Hinduism and some schools of Buddhism, the areca nut is still used along with betel leaf in religious ceremonies, and also while honoring individuals in much of southern Asia. </p><p>In Assam, as well as most of its neighbouring Northeastern states, Areca Nut is preferably consumed in its fermented form, which is supposed to make the fruit harder and sweeter. The raw nut may also be eaten during certain seasons when the fermented variety becomes unavailable, although it has more of ritual importance. Standard sized pieces of the nut and leaf are usually consumed in combination with lime and a bit of tobacco. In Assam, betel nut and leaf has indispensable cultural value; offering betel leaf and nut, (together known as <i>gua</i>) constitutes a part of social greeting and socialising. It is a tradition to offer <i>pan-tamul</i> (betel leaves and raw areca nut) to guests immediately upon arrival, and after tea or meals, served in a brass plate with stands called <i>bota</i>. In traditional Assamese societies carrying a pouch of <i>tamul-pan</i> upon one's person during journeys or during farming activities, and sharing of the same, was an essential requirement. Among the Assamese, the areca nut also has a variety of uses during religious and marriage ceremonies, where it has the role of a fertility symbol. No religious ritual is complete without the offering of <i>tamul-pan</i> to the gods and spirits as well as to the assembled guests A tradition from Upper Assam is to invite guests to wedding receptions by offering a few areca nuts with betel leaves. During Bihu, the <i>husori</i> players are offered areca nuts and betel leaves by each household while their blessings are solicited. </p><p>Spanish mariner Álvaro de Mendaña reported observing Solomon Islanders chewing the nut and the leaf with caustic lime, and the manner in which the habit stained their mouths red. He noted the friendly and genial chief Malope, on Santa Isabel Island, would offer him the combination as a token of friendship every time they met. </p><p>In Bhutan, the areca nut is called <i>doma</i>. The soft and moist raw areca nut is very potent. When chewed it can cause palpitation and vasoconstriction. This form is eaten in the lower regions of Bhutan and in North Bengal, where the nut is cut into half and put into a local <i>paan</i> leaf with a generous amount of lime. In the rest of Bhutan the raw nut, with the husk on, is fermented such that the husk rots and is easy to extract. The fermented doma has a putrid odour, which can be smelled from miles. Traditionally, this fragrant nut is cut in half and placed on top of a cone made of local betel leaf, which has a dash of lime put into it. \"Myth has it that the inhabitants of Bhutan traditionally known as Monyul, the land of Monpas where Buddhism did not reach lived on raw flesh, drank blood, and chewed bones. After the arrival of Guru Rinpoche in the eighth century, he stopped the people from eating flesh and drinking blood and created a substitute which is betel leaf, lime and areca nut. Today, chewing doma has become a custom. Doma is served after meals, during rituals and ceremonies. It is offered to friends and is chewed at work places by all sections of society and has become an essential part of Bhutanese life and culture.\" </p><p>The addition of tobacco leaf to the chewing mixture is a relatively recent innovation, as tobacco was not introduced from the Americas until the colonial era. </p><p>Reasons for starting to consume areca nuts appears to involve complex psychosocial factors. </p> <p>The husk, which is between 50 and 75 percent of the weight and volume of an areca fruit, serves as the source of fiber for the construction industry. Typically, these fibers are considered to be waste, but can be used to strengthen construction materials. </p> <ul> <li> <p><a href=\"/wiki/File:Grade1bottom.jpg\" title=\"Areca nuts\"><img alt=\"Areca nuts\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Grade1bottom.jpg/120px-Grade1bottom.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"120\" height=\"120\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Grade1bottom.jpg/250px-Grade1bottom.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"3456\" data-file-height=\"3456\"></a></p> <p>Areca nuts</p> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"/wiki/File:Betel_nut_merchant.jpg\" title=\"Betel nut saleswoman, Papua New Guinea\"><img alt=\"Betel nut saleswoman, Papua New Guinea\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Betel_nut_merchant.jpg/120px-Betel_nut_merchant.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"120\" height=\"95\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Betel_nut_merchant.jpg/250px-Betel_nut_merchant.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"984\" data-file-height=\"776\"></a></p> <div><p>Betel nut saleswoman, Papua New Guinea</p></div> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"/wiki/File:Paan_Making.jpg\" title=\"Shopkeeper making paan in an Indian store\"><img alt=\"Shopkeeper making paan in an Indian store\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Paan_Making.jpg/120px-Paan_Making.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"120\" height=\"90\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Paan_Making.jpg/250px-Paan_Making.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"819\" data-file-height=\"614\"></a></p> <p>Shopkeeper making <i>paan</i> in an Indian store</p> </li> <li> <p><a href=\"/wiki/File:Betel_box_from_the_Philippines,_Mindanao,_Maranao_people,_probably_20th_century,_copper_alloy_with_silver_inlay,_HAA.JPG\" title=\"A betel nut box crafted by the Maranao people of the Philippines\"><img alt=\"A betel nut box crafted by the Maranao people of the Philippines\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Betel_box_from_the_Philippines%2C_Mindanao%2C_Maranao_people%2C_probably_20th_century%2C_copper_alloy_with_silver_inlay%2C_HAA.JPG/120px-Betel_box_from_the_Philippines%2C_Mindanao%2C_Maranao_people%2C_probably_20th_century%2C_copper_alloy_with_silver_inlay%2C_HAA.JPG\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"120\" height=\"68\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Betel_box_from_the_Philippines%2C_Mindanao%2C_Maranao_people%2C_probably_20th_century%2C_copper_alloy_with_silver_inlay%2C_HAA.JPG/250px-Betel_box_from_the_Philippines%2C_Mindanao%2C_Maranao_people%2C_probably_20th_century%2C_copper_alloy_with_silver_inlay%2C_HAA.JPG 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"2524\" data-file-height=\"1424\"></a></p> <div><p>A betel nut box crafted by the Maranao people of the Philippines</p></div> </li> <li> <p>Dried Betelnut's outer shell being removed.</p> </li> </ul> <ul><li>List of herbs with known adverse effects</li></ul> <div><ol> <li >^ <a href=\"#cite_ref-Zumbroich2007_1-0\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Zumbroich2007_1-1\"></a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-Zumbroich2007_1-2\"></a> <cite >Zumbroich TJ (2007–2008). <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ugp.rug.nl/eJIM/article/download/24712/22162\">\"The origin and diffusion of betel chewing: a synthesis of evidence from South Asia, Southeast Asia and beyond\"</a>. <i>eJournal of Indian Medicine</i>. <b>1</b>: 87–140.</cite></span> </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-powo_2-0\">^</a></b> <cite><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:664107-1\">\"<i>Areca catechu</i> L.\"</a> <i>Plants of the World Online</i>.

The palm is originally native to the [Philippines](/wiki/Philippines),[[1]](#cite_note-Zumbroich2007-1)[[2]](#cite_note-powo-2) but was carried widely through the tropics by the [Austronesian migrations](/wiki/Austronesian_expansion) and [trade](/wiki/Spice_trade) since at least 1500 BCE due to its use in [betel nut chewing](/wiki/Betel_nut_chewing).[[1]](#cite_note-Zumbroich2007-1) It is widespread in cultivation and is considered naturalized in much of the tropical Pacific ([Melanesia](/wiki/Melanesia) and [Micronesia](/wiki/Micronesia)), [South Asia](/wiki/South_Asia), [Southeast Asia](/wiki/Southeast_Asia), and parts of east Africa. It is not to be confused with [betel](/wiki/Betel) (*Piper betle*) leaves that are often used to wrap it. The practice of betel nut chewing, often together with other herbs as a [stimulant drug](/wiki/Stimulant_drug), dates back thousands of years, and continues to the present day in many countries.\nBetel nut chewing is addictive due to the presence of the stimulant [arecoline](/wiki/Arecoline) and causes adverse health effects—mainly [oral](/wiki/Oral_cancer) and [esophageal cancers](/wiki/Esophageal_cancer), as well as cardiovascular disease. When chewed with additional tobacco in its preparation (like in [gutka](/wiki/Gutka)), there is an even higher risk, especially for oral and [oropharyngeal cancers](/wiki/Oropharyngeal_cancer). With tobacco it also raises the risk of fatal [coronary artery disease](/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease), fatal [stroke](/wiki/Stroke), and adverse reproductive effects, including [stillbirth](/wiki/Stillbirth), [premature birth](/wiki/Preterm_birth), and [low birth weight](/wiki/Low_birth_weight).\nConsumption by hundreds of millions of people worldwide—mainly of South/Southeast Asian origin—has been described as a [public health](/wiki/Public_health) emergency.\n\nThe term *areca* originated from [Dravidian languages](/wiki/Dravidian_languages), cognates of which are:[[3]](#cite_note-3)[[4]](#cite_note-4)\n\n- [Malayalam](/wiki/Malayalam_language): അടയ്ക്ക, [romanized](/wiki/Romanization_of_Malayalam):&#160;*aṭaykka*\n\n- [Kannada](/wiki/Kannada_language): ಅಡಿಕೆ, romanized:&#160;*adike*\n\n- [Tamil](/wiki/Tamil_language): அடைக்காய், romanized:&#160;*aḍaikkāy*[[5]](#cite_note-MW_Collegiate-5)\n\nThe terms dates back to the [16th century](/wiki/16th_century), when Dutch and Portuguese sailors took the nut from India to Europe.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Areca_catechu_nuts_at_Kadavoor.jpg/250px-Areca_catechu_nuts_at_Kadavoor.jpg)](/wiki/File:Areca_catechu_nuts_at_Kadavoor.jpg)Areca fruits on a tree\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Betel_nut_palms_in_Ponda%2C_Goa.jpeg/250px-Betel_nut_palms_in_Ponda%2C_Goa.jpeg)](/wiki/File:Betel_nut_palms_in_Ponda,_Goa.jpeg)Areca nut palm plantation in [Goa](/wiki/Goa), India\nThe areca nut is not a [true nut](/wiki/True_nut), but rather the seed of a fruit categorized as a [berry](/wiki/Berry_(botany)). It is commercially available in dried, cured, and fresh forms. When the husk of the fresh fruit is green, the nut inside is soft enough to be cut with a typical knife. In the ripe fruit, the husk becomes yellow or orange, and as it dries, the fruit inside hardens to a wood-like consistency. At that stage, the areca nut can only be sliced using a special [scissors](/wiki/Scissors)-like cutter.[[6]](#cite_note-6)\nUsually, for chewing, a few slices of the nut are wrapped in a [betel](/wiki/Betel) leaf along with [calcium hydroxide](/wiki/Calcium_hydroxide) (slaked lime) and may include [clove](/wiki/Clove), [cardamom](/wiki/Cardamom), [catechu](/wiki/Catechu) resin (*kattha*), or other spices for extra flavouring. Betel leaf has a fresh, peppery taste, but it can also be bitter to varying degrees, depending on the variety.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]\nAreca nuts are chewed for their effects as a mild stimulant,[[7]](#cite_note-7) causing a warming sensation in the body and slightly heightened alertness, although the effects vary from person to person.\nThe first nut cultivation in the world was done in Kyasanuru Seeme area of Shimoga district in Karnataka state of India. Even today, the cultivators plant the same variety here. The Kyasanuru variety gives high yields and grows wild in all regions.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]\nIn parts of India, [Sri Lanka](/wiki/Sri_Lanka), and southern China, areca nuts are not only chewed along with betel leaf, but are also used in the preparation of [Ayurvedic](/wiki/Ayurvedic_Medicine) and [traditional Chinese medicines](/wiki/Chinese_herbology). Powdered areca nut is used as a constituent in some [dentifrices](/wiki/Dentifrice).[[8]](#cite_note-Bhat-8) Other traditional uses include the removal of [tapeworms](/wiki/Tapeworm) and other [intestinal parasites](/wiki/Intestinal_parasite) by swallowing a few teaspoons of powdered areca nut, drunk as a [decoction](/wiki/Decoction), or by taking tablets containing the extracted alkaloids.[[8]](#cite_note-Bhat-8) According to traditional Ayurvedic medicine, chewing areca nut and betel leaf is a good remedy against [bad breath](/wiki/Halitosis).[[9]](#cite_note-9)[*[unreliable source?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources)*] Diplomat [Edmund Roberts](/wiki/Edmund_Roberts_(diplomat)) noted that Chinese people would mix areca nut with *[Uncaria gambir](/wiki/Uncaria_gambir)* during his visit to China in the 1830s.[[10]](#cite_note-Roberts1-10) After chewing a betel nut, the red residue is generally spat out. Accordingly, places have banned chewing this nut to avoid eyesores.[[11]](#cite_note-11)[[12]](#cite_note-12)[[13]](#cite_note-13)\n\nThe major [alkaloid](/wiki/Alkaloid) in betel nut is [arecoline](/wiki/Arecoline). There are other compounds, such as [arecaidine](/wiki/Arecaidine), [guvacine](/wiki/Guvacine), [isoguvacine](/wiki/Isoguvacine), and [guvacoline](/wiki/Guvacoline). [Tannins](/wiki/Tannin) present in betel nut are mainly [proanthocyanidins](/wiki/Proanthocyanidin) along with catechins and arecatannin.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] Two new alkaloids were recently discovered and named acatechu A and acatechu B.[[14]](#cite_note-pmid31351128-14) Several non-alkaloid compounds including benzenoids, [terpenes](/wiki/Terpenes), [carboxylic acids](/wiki/Carboxylic_acid), [aldehydes](/wiki/Aldehyde), alcohols, and [esters](/wiki/Ester) were also identified.[[15]](#cite_note-15)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Lao_woman_chewing_paan.jpg/330px-Lao_woman_chewing_paan.jpg)](/wiki/File:Lao_woman_chewing_paan.jpg)A woman with the characteristic red-stained teeth and gums from long term use.Chewing areca nut increases the risk of multiple forms of cancer and cardiovascular disease, with or without added tobacco.[[16]](#cite_note-WHOCancer2-16)[[17]](#cite_note-17)[[18]](#cite_note-18)\nBetel nut chewing causes an increased risk of [head and neck cancers](/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer) and [esophageal cancer](/wiki/Esophageal_cancer).[[19]](#cite_note-NCI2-19)[[20]](#cite_note-20)[[21]](#cite_note-21) Betel quid affects almost all parts of the human body, including the brain, heart, lungs, [gastrointestinal tract](/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract) and reproductive organs.

It is available practically everywhere and is sold in ready-to-chew pouches called pan masala* or *supari*, which is the dried form of the areca nut, as a mixture of many flavours whose primary base is dried areca nut crushed into small pieces. Poor people, who may eat only every other day, use it to stave off [hunger pangs](/wiki/Hunger).[[34]](#cite_note-Javed-2010-34)[[36]](#cite_note-Collingham2006-36) *Pan masala* with a small quantity of tobacco is called *[gutka](/wiki/Gutka)*. The easily discarded, small plastic *supari* or *gutka* pouches are a ubiquitous pollutant of the South Asian environment. Some of the liquid in the mouth is usually disposed of by spitting, producing bright red spots wherever the expectorate lands.\nIn the [Maldives](/wiki/Maldives), areca nut chewing is very popular, but spitting is frowned upon and regarded as an unrefined, repulsive way of chewing. Usually, people prefer to chew thin slices of the dry nut, which is sometimes roasted. *Killi*, a mixture of areca nut, betel, cloves, cardamom and sugar is sold in small home-made paper pouches. Old people who have lost their teeth keep \"chewing\" by pounding the mixture of areca nut and betel with a small mortar and pestle.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]\n\nIn Thailand, the consumption of areca nut has declined gradually in the last decades. The younger generation rarely chews the substance, especially in the cities. Most of the present-day consumption is confined to older generations, mostly people above 50. Even so, small trays of betel leaves and sliced tender areca nut are sold in markets and used as offerings in Buddhist shrines.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]\nIn the northern Philippines, particularly the [Cordillera Administrative Region](/wiki/Cordillera_Administrative_Region), betel nut chewing remains prominent to the point that restrictions and fines have been established in urban areas such as [Baguio City](/wiki/Baguio) in the [Benguet](/wiki/Benguet) province. These restrictions were made under the idea that *momma* or *moma* (betel nut) chewing and spitting are improper during public transportation drivers' work hours and are considered stains to the city roads and sidewalks.[[37]](#cite_note-37) Despite these restrictions, betel nut thrives across the Cordilleran market. An example of its commerciality can be observed in [Ifugao](/wiki/Ifugao), one of the provinces of the Philippine Cordilleras, where betel nuts are high-demand products sourced from the province's different cities and municipalities.[[38]](#cite_note-38)\nIn [Bahasa Indonesia](/wiki/Bahasa_Indonesia), the betel nut is known as *makan pinang*, while in the [Papua Province](/wiki/Papua_Province) of Indonesia, it is known simply as *pinang*.[[25]](#cite_note-indonesia-25) The [Pinang scissor](/wiki/Pinang_scissor) was developed specifically for cutting it.[[39]](#cite_note-39)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Eating_Pinang_prohibited.jpg/250px-Eating_Pinang_prohibited.jpg)](/wiki/File:Eating_Pinang_prohibited.jpg)Sign saying that chewing betel-nut is prohibited, at Sentani Airport, Jayapura, Papua Province, Indonesia\nIn [Papua New Guinea](/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea) (PNG), betel nuts are referred to in [Tok Pisin](/wiki/Tok_Pisin) as *buai*, and grow abundantly on the northern coast, in [Wewak](/wiki/Wewak) and [Madang](/wiki/Madang).[[40]](#cite_note-swanston2023-40) A controversial ban on selling and chewing betel nut in public places in [Port Moresby](/wiki/Port_Moresby), introduced in 2014 by the governor, was lifted in 2017. Because the popular nut continued to be smuggled in, prices rose dramatically. Police enforced the ban rigorously, and in 2015 two betel nut sellers died in [Hanuabada](/wiki/Hanuabada) after police reservists fired on a crowd.[[41]](#cite_note-41) The governor of Port Moresby introduced another ban on the nut, restricted to an area in the business district of the city in July 2023. However many people make a living out of selling betel nut, so are resistant to bans in their areas.[[42]](#cite_note-42) On [Manus Island](/wiki/Manus_Island), young men are exposed to piracy when they use small boats to travel to the northern coast to purchase betel nuts to trade, and several have disappeared.[[40]](#cite_note-swanston2023-40)\nIn Australia, the importation, use, and sale of areca nut is banned, but it has been sold illegally in several [South Asian](/wiki/South_Asian_cuisine) supermarkets.[[43]](#cite_note-43)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Areca_nuts_in_China_01.jpg/250px-Areca_nuts_in_China_01.jpg)](/wiki/File:Areca_nuts_in_China_01.jpg)Areca nuts as sold in [Hainan](/wiki/Hainan), China\nIn [Hainan](/wiki/Hainan) and [Hunan Province](/wiki/Hunan_Province), China, where [Xiangtan](/wiki/Xiangtan) is a center of use and processing,[[44]](#cite_note-44) a wide range of old and young people consume areca nut daily. Most, though, consume the dried variety of the nut by itself, without the betel leaves. Some people also consume the areca nut in its raw, fresh form with or without the betel leaves. Betel nuts are sold mostly by old women merchants, but the dried version can be found in shops that sell tea, alcohol, and cigarettes.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]\nIn Taiwan, bags of 20 to 40 areca nuts are purchased fresh daily by a large number of consumers. To meet the steady year-round demand, two kinds of betel-nut shops sell betel and nuts, as well as cigarettes and drinks, including beer: small [mom and pop shops](/wiki/Mom_and_pop_shop), often poorly maintained and with unassuming [façades](/wiki/Facade), and shops which will often consist of nothing more than a single, free-standing room, or booth. The latter is usually elevated one meter above the street, and measures less than 3 by 2 m. Large picture windows comprise two or more of the walls, allowing those who pass by a complete view of the interior. The interior is often painted brightly. Within such a shop, a [sexily](/wiki/Sexily) dressed young woman, a \"[betel nut beauty](/wiki/Betel_nut_beauty)\", can be seen preparing betel and areca nuts. Shops are often identified by colorful (commonly green) LED lamps or [neon lights](/wiki/Neon_light) that frame the windows or that are arranged radially above a store. Customers stop on the side of the road and wait for the girls to bring their betel and areca nut to their vehicles. The habit of chewing betel nut is often associated with blue-collar labor industries such as long-haul transportation, construction, or fishing. Workers in these labor-intensive industries use betel nut for its stimulating effect, but it also becomes a tool for socializing with coworkers. For example, studies have shown chewing betel nut is prevalent among taxi, bus and truck drivers, who rely on the stimulating effect of betel nut to cope with long work hours.[[45]](#cite_note-45)[[46]](#cite_note-46)[[47]](#cite_note-47) For these reasons, oral cancer has been identified as a leading cause of death in professions with high betel nut-chewing rates.[[48]](#cite_note-48)\n\nIn the United States, areca nut is not a controlled or specially taxed substance and may be found in some Asian grocery stores. However, importation of areca nut in a form other than whole or carved kernels of nuts can be stopped at the discretion of US Customs officers on the grounds of food, agricultural, or medicinal drug violations.[[49]](#cite_note-49)\nIn the United Kingdom the betel nut is legal.[[50]](#cite_note-50)\nPossession of areca nut or betel leaf is banned in the [UAE](/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates) and is a punishable offence.[[51]](#cite_note-51)\n\n### Traditional consumption\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Paan60.jpg/250px-Paan60.jpg)](/wiki/File:Paan60.jpg)Display of the items usually included in a chewing session: The betel leaves are folded, with slices of the dry areca nut on the upper left hand and slices of the tender areca nut on the upper right. The pouch on the lower right contains tobacco, a relatively recent introduction.\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Betelnut-Cutter%2C_Indonesia.JPG/250px-Betelnut-Cutter%2C_Indonesia.JPG)](/wiki/File:Betelnut-Cutter,_Indonesia.JPG)Areca nut cutter from Indonesia\nChewing the mixture of areca nut and betel leaf constitutes an important and popular cultural activity in many [South Asian](/wiki/South_Asia), [Southeast Asian](/wiki/Southeast_Asia), [East Asian](/wiki/East_Asia) and [Oceanic](/wiki/Oceania) countries. Why or when the areca nut and the betel leaf were first combined into one psychoactive drug is not known. Archaeological evidence from Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines suggests they have been used in tandem for at least 4,000 years.[[52]](#cite_note-52)\nThe oldest unequivocal evidence of betel chewing is from the Philippines, specifically that of several individuals found in a burial pit in the [Duyong Cave](/wiki/Duyong_Cave) site of [Palawan](/wiki/Palawan) island dated to around 2680±250 [BCE](/wiki/BCE). The dentition of the skeletons is stained, typical of betel chewers. The grave also includes *[Anadara](/wiki/Anadara)* shells used as containers of lime, one of which still contained lime. Burial sites in [Bohol](/wiki/Bohol) dated to the first millennium CE also show the distinctive reddish stains characteristic of betel chewing. Based on linguistic evidence of how the reconstructed [Proto-Austronesian](/wiki/Proto-Austronesian) term **buaq* originally meaning \"fruit\" came to refer to \"areca nut\" in [Proto-Malayo-Polynesian](/wiki/Proto-Malayo-Polynesian), it is believed that betel chewing originally developed somewhere within the Philippines shortly after the beginning of the [Austronesian expansion](/wiki/Austronesian_expansion) (~3000 BCE). From the Philippines, it spread back to Taiwan, as well as onwards to the rest of [Austronesia](/wiki/Austronesia) and in neighboring cultures through trade and migration.[[1]](#cite_note-Zumbroich2007-1)\nIn Vietnam, the areca nut and the betel leaf are such important symbols of love and marriage that in [Vietnamese](/wiki/Vietnamese_language) the phrase \"matters of betel and areca\" (*chuyện trầu cau*) is synonymous with marriage.  The tradition of chewing areca nuts starts the talk between the groom's parents and the bride's parents about the young couple's marriage. Therefore, the leaves and juices are used ceremonially in Vietnamese weddings. The folk tale explaining the origin of this Vietnamese tradition is a good illustration of the belief that the combination of areca nut and the betel leaf is ideal to the point they are practically inseparable, like an idealized married couple.[[53]](#cite_note-53)\nFormerly, in both India and Sri Lanka, it was a custom of the royalty to chew areca nut with betel leaf. Kings had special attendants whose duty it was to carry a box with all the necessary ingredients for a good chewing session. There was also a custom for lovers to chew areca nut and betel leaf together, because of its breath-freshening and relaxant properties. A sexual symbolism thus became attached to the chewing of the nut and the leaf. The areca nut represented the male principle, and the betel leaf the female principle. Considered an auspicious ingredient in [Hinduism](/wiki/Hinduism) and some schools of [Buddhism](/wiki/Buddhism), the areca nut is still used along with betel leaf in religious ceremonies, and also while honoring individuals in much of southern Asia.[[54]](#cite_note-rrh-54)\nIn [Assam](/wiki/Assam), as well as most of its neighbouring Northeastern states, Areca Nut is preferably consumed in its fermented form, which is supposed to make the fruit harder and sweeter. The raw nut may also be eaten during certain seasons when the fermented variety becomes unavailable, although it has more of ritual importance. Standard sized pieces of the nut and leaf are usually consumed in combination with lime and a bit of tobacco. In Assam, betel nut and leaf has indispensable cultural value; offering betel leaf and nut, (together known as *gua*) constitutes a part of social greeting and socialising. It is a tradition to offer *pan-tamul* (betel leaves and raw areca nut) to guests immediately upon arrival, and after tea or meals, served in a brass plate with stands called  *bota*. In traditional Assamese societies carrying a pouch of *tamul-pan* upon one's person during journeys or during farming activities, and sharing of the same, was an essential requirement. Among the Assamese, the areca nut also has a variety of uses during religious and marriage ceremonies, where it has the role of a fertility symbol. No religious ritual is complete without the offering of *tamul-pan* to the gods and spirits as well as to the assembled guests [[55]](#cite_note-55) A tradition from Upper Assam is to invite guests to wedding receptions by offering a few areca nuts with betel leaves. During [Bihu](/wiki/Bihu), the *husori* players are offered areca nuts and betel leaves by each household while their blessings are solicited.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]\nSpanish mariner [Álvaro de Mendaña](/wiki/%C3%81lvaro_de_Menda%C3%B1a_de_Neira) reported observing [Solomon Islanders](/wiki/Solomon_Islands) chewing the nut and the leaf with caustic lime, and the manner in which the habit stained their mouths red. He noted the friendly and genial chief Malope, on [Santa Isabel Island](/wiki/Santa_Isabel_Island), would offer him the combination as a token of friendship every time they met.[[56]](#cite_note-56)\nIn [Bhutan](/wiki/Bhutan), the areca nut is called *doma*. The soft and moist raw areca nut is very potent. When chewed it can cause [palpitation](/wiki/Palpitations) and [vasoconstriction](/wiki/Vasoconstriction). This form is eaten in the lower regions of Bhutan and in North Bengal, where the nut is cut into half and put into a local *paan* leaf with a generous amount of lime. In the rest of Bhutan the raw nut, with the husk on, is fermented such that the husk rots and is easy to extract. The fermented doma has a putrid odour, which can be smelled from miles.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] Traditionally, this fragrant nut is cut in half and placed on top of a cone made of local betel leaf, which has a dash of lime put into it. \"Myth has it that the inhabitants of Bhutan traditionally known as Monyul, the land of Monpas where Buddhism did not reach lived on raw flesh, drank blood, and chewed bones. After the arrival of Guru Rinpoche in the eighth century, he stopped the people from eating flesh and drinking blood and created a substitute which is betel leaf, lime and areca nut. Today, chewing doma has become a custom. Doma is served after meals, during rituals and ceremonies. It is offered to friends and is chewed at work places by all sections of society and has become an essential part of Bhutanese life and culture.\"[[57]](#cite_note-57)\nThe addition of tobacco leaf to the chewing mixture is a relatively recent innovation, as tobacco was not introduced from the [Americas](/wiki/Americas) until the colonial era.\nReasons for starting to consume areca nuts appears to involve complex [psychosocial](/wiki/Psychosocial) factors.[[58]](#cite_note-More-2020-58)\n\nThe husk, which is between 50 and 75 percent of the weight and volume of an areca fruit, serves as the source of fiber for the [construction industry](/wiki/Construction). Typically, these fibers are considered to be waste, but can be used to strengthen construction materials.[[59]](#cite_note-59)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Grade1bottom.jpg/120px-Grade1bottom.jpg)](/wiki/File:Grade1bottom.jpg)\n\n\t\t\tAreca nuts\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Betel_nut_merchant.jpg/120px-Betel_nut_merchant.jpg)](/wiki/File:Betel_nut_merchant.jpg)\n\n\t\t\tBetel nut saleswoman, [Papua New Guinea](/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Paan_Making.jpg/120px-Paan_Making.jpg)](/wiki/File:Paan_Making.jpg)\n\n\t\t\tShopkeeper making *paan* in an Indian store\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Betel_box_from_the_Philippines%2C_Mindanao%2C_Maranao_people%2C_probably_20th_century%2C_copper_alloy_with_silver_inlay%2C_HAA.JPG/120px-Betel_box_from_the_Philippines%2C_Mindanao%2C_Maranao_people%2C_probably_20th_century%2C_copper_alloy_with_silver_inlay%2C_HAA.JPG)](/wiki/File:Betel_box_from_the_Philippines,_Mindanao,_Maranao_people,_probably_20th_century,_copper_alloy_with_silver_inlay,_HAA.JPG)\n\n\t\t\tA betel nut box crafted by the [Maranao people](/wiki/Maranao_people) of the [Philippines](/wiki/Philippines)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tDried Betelnut's outer shell being removed.\n\n\t\t\n\n- [List of herbs with known adverse effects](/wiki/List_of_herbs_with_known_adverse_effects)\n\n^ [***a***](#cite_ref-Zumbroich2007_1-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-Zumbroich2007_1-1) [***c***](#cite_ref-Zumbroich2007_1-2) Zumbroich TJ (2007–2008).

This substance is present at very low concentrations in common foodstuffs such as orange juice and other orange (<i>Citrus</i> species) products, both of the \"sweet\" and \"bitter\" variety. The preparations used in traditional Chinese medicine (<b>TCM</b>), also known as Zhi Shi (枳实), are the immature and dried whole oranges from <i>Citrus aurantium</i> (<i>Fructus Aurantii Immaturus</i>). Extracts of the same material or purified synephrine are also marketed in the US, sometimes in combination with caffeine, as a weight-loss-promoting dietary supplement for oral consumption. While the traditional preparations have been in use for millennia as a component of TCM-formulas, synephrine itself is not an approved over the counter drug. As a pharmaceutical, <i>m</i>-synephrine (phenylephrine) is still used as a sympathomimetic (i.e. for its hypertensive and vasoconstrictor properties), mostly by injection for the treatment of emergencies such as shock, and rarely orally for the treatment of bronchial problems associated with asthma and hay-fever. </p><p>There is a difference between studies concerning synephrine as a single chemical entity (synephrine can exist in the form of either of two stereoisomers, d- and l-synephrine, which are chemically and pharmacologically distinct), and synephrine which is mixed with other drugs and/or botanical extracts in a \"supplement\", as well as synephrine which is present as only one chemical component in a naturally-occurring mixture of phytochemicals such as the rind or fruit of a bitter orange. Mixtures containing synephrine as only one of their chemical components (regardless of whether these are of synthetic or natural origin) should not be assumed to produce exactly the same biological effects as synephrine alone. </p><p>In physical appearance, synephrine is a colorless, crystalline solid and is water-soluble. Its molecular structure is based on a phenethylamine skeleton and is related to those of many other drugs and to the major neurotransmitters epinephrine and norepinephrine. </p> <meta property=\"mw:PageProp/toc\"> <div><h2 >Natural occurrences</h2><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Synephrine&action=edit&section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Natural occurrences\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Synephrine, although already known as a synthetic organic compound, was first isolated as a natural product from the leaves of various <i>Citrus</i> trees, and its presence noted in different <i>Citrus</i> juices, by Stewart and co-workers in the early 1960s. A survey of the distribution of synephrine amongst the higher plants was published in 1970 by Wheaton and Stewart. It has subsequently been detected in <i>Evodia</i> and <i>Zanthoxylum</i> species, all plants of the family Rutaceae. </p><p>Trace levels (0.003%) of synephrine have also been detected in the dried leaves of <i>Pogostemon cablin</i> (patchouli, Lamiaceae). It is also found in certain cactus species of the genera <i>Coryphantha</i> and <i>Dolichothele</i>. </p><p>However, this compound is found predominantly in a number of <i>Citrus</i> species, including \"bitter\" orange varieties. </p> <p>Extracts of unripe fruit from Asian cultivars of <i>Citrus aurantium</i> (commonly known as \"bitter\" orange), collected in China, were reported to contain synephrine levels of about 0.1–0.3%, or ~1–3&#160;mg/g; Analysis of dried fruit of <i>C. aurantium</i> grown in Italy showed a concentration of synephrine of ~1&#160;mg/g, with peel containing over three times more than the pulp. </p><p>Sweet oranges of the Tarocco, Naveline and Navel varieties, bought on the Italian market, were found to contain ~13–34 μg/g (corresponding to 13–34&#160;mg/kg) synephrine (with roughly equal concentrations in juice and separated pulp); from these results, it was calculated that eating one \"average\" Tarocco orange would result in the consumption of ~6&#160;mg of synephrine. </p><p>An analysis of 32 different orange \"jams\", originating mostly in the US and UK, but including samples from France, Italy, Spain, or Lebanon, showed synephrine levels ranging from 0.05&#160;mg/g–0.0009&#160;mg/g in those jams made from bitter oranges, and levels of 0.05&#160;mg/g–0.006&#160;mg/g of synephrine in jams made from sweet oranges. </p><p>Synephrine has been found in marmalade made from <i>Citrus unshiu</i> (Satsuma mandarin) obtained in Japan, at a concentration of ~0.12&#160;mg/g (or about 2.4&#160;mg/20g serving). Most of the orange marmalades made in the US are produced using \"sweet\" oranges (<i>C. sinensis</i>), whereas \"bitter\" or Seville oranges (<i>C. aurantium</i>) are used for making the more traditional, bitterer marmalades in the United Kingdom. </p><p>A sample of commercial Japanese <i>C. unshiu</i> juice was found to contain ~0.36&#160;mg/g synephrine (or roughly 360&#160;mg/L), while in juice products obtained from a Satsuma mandarin variety grown in California, levels of synephrine ranged from 55 to 160&#160;mg/L . </p><p>Juices from \"sweet\" oranges purchased in Brazilian markets were found to contain ~10–22&#160;mg/L synephrine; commercial orange soft drinks obtained on the Brazilian market had an average synephrine content of ~1&#160;mg/L. Commercial Italian orange juices contained ~13–32&#160;mg/L of synephrine </p><p>In a survey of over 50 citrus fruit juices, either commercially-prepared or hand-squeezed from fresh fruit, obtained on the US market, Avula and co-workers found synephrine levels ranging from ~4–60&#160;mg/L; no synephrine was detected in juices from grapefruit, lime, or lemon. </p><p>An analysis of the synephrine levels in a range of different citrus fruits, carried out on juices that had been extracted from fresh, peeled fruit, was reported by Uckoo and co-workers, with the following results: Marrs sweet orange (<i>C. sinensis</i> Tan.): ~85&#160;mg/L; Nova tangerine (<i>C. reticulata</i> Tan.): ~78&#160;mg/L; clementine (<i>C. clementina</i> Tan.): ~115&#160;mg/L; Meyer lemon (<i>C. limon</i> Tan.) ~3&#160;mg/kg; Ugli tangelo (<i>C. reticulata</i> × <i>C. paradisi</i>) ~47&#160;mg/kg. No synephrine was detected in: Rio Red grapefruit (<i>C. paradisi</i> Macf.); Red-fleshed pummelo (<i>C. grandis</i> Tan.); or Wekiwa tangelo (<i>C. reticulata</i> × <i>C. paradisi</i>). </p><p>Numerous additional comparable analyses of the synephrine content of <i>Citrus</i> fruits and products derived from them may be found in the research literature. </p> <div><h3 >In humans and other animals</h3><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Synephrine&action=edit&section=3\" title=\"Edit section: In humans and other animals\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Low levels of synephrine have been found in normal human urine, as well as in other mammalian tissue. To reduce the likelihood that the synephrine detected in urine had a dietary origin, the subjects tested by Ibrahim and co-workers abstained from the consumption of any citrus products for 48 hours prior to providing urine samples. </p><p>A 2006 study of synephrine in human blood platelets by D'Andrea and co-workers showed increased levels in platelets from patients suffering from aura-associated migraine (0.72&#160;ng/10 platelets, compared to 0.33&#160;ng/10 platelets in control subjects). Earlier, the same research group had reported a normal human blood plasma level of synephrine of 0.90–13.69&#160;ng/mL. </p> <p>Since synephrine exists as either of two enantiomers (see Chemistry section below for further discussion), which do not produce identical biological effects (see Pharmacology section below) some researchers have examined the stereoisomeric composition of synephrine extracted from natural sources. Although it seems clear that synephrine is found in those <i>Citrus</i> species which have been studied predominantly as the l-isomer, low levels of d-synephrine have been detected in juice and marmalade made from <i>C. unshiu</i>, and low levels (0.002%) have been reported in fresh fruit from <i>C. aurantium</i>. There are indications that some d-synephrine may be formed by the racemization of l-synephrine as a result of the processing of fresh fruit, although this matter has not been completely clarified. However, regardless of the situation in <i>Citrus</i> species, Ranieri and McLaughlin reported the <i>isolation</i> of racemic (i.e. a mixture of equal amounts of d- and l- stereoisomers) synephrine from a cactus of the genus <i>Dolichothele</i>, under conditions that would be unlikely to cause a significant amount of racemization. </p> <p>The biosynthesis of synephrine in <i>Citrus</i> species is believed to follow the pathway: tyrosine → tyramine → <a href=\"/wiki/N-methyltyramine\" title=\"N-methyltyramine\"><i>N</i>-methyltyramine</a> → synephrine, involving the enzymes tyrosine decarboxylase in the first step, <a href=\"/wiki/Tyramine_N-methyltransferase\" title=\"Tyramine N-methyltransferase\">tyramine <i>N</i>-methyltransferase</a> in the second, and <i>N</i>-methyl-tyramine-β-hydroxylase in the third. This pathway differs from that thought to occur in animals, involving octopamine: tyramine → octopamine → synephrine, where the conversion of tyramine to octopamine is mediated by dopamine-β-hydroxylase, and the conversion of octopamine to synephrine by <a href=\"/wiki/Phenylethanolamine_N-methyltransferase\" title=\"Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase\">phenylethanolamine <i>N</i>-methyltransferase</a>. </p> <div><h2 >Presence in nutritional/dietary supplements</h2><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Synephrine&action=edit&section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Presence in nutritional/dietary supplements\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Some dietary supplements, sold for the purposes of promoting weight-loss or providing energy, contain synephrine as one of several constituents. Usually, the synephrine is present as a natural component of <i>Citrus aurantium</i> (\"bitter orange\"), bound up in the plant matrix, but could also be of synthetic origin, or a purified phytochemical (i.e. extracted from a plant source and purified to chemical homogeneity). The concentration range found by Santana and co-workers in five different supplements purchased in the US was about 5–14&#160;mg/g. </p> <p>As a synthetic drug, synephrine first appeared in Europe in the late 1920s, under the name of <i>Sympatol</i>. One of the earliest papers describing its pharmacological and toxicological properties was written by Lasch, who obtained it from the Viennese company Syngala. By 1930, <i>Sympatol</i> was referred to as a Boehringer product, while one of the first US Patents describing its preparation and use was assigned to Frederick Stearns &amp; Co. in 1933. Despite the date of this patent, clinical and pharmacological research on synephrine obtained from Frederick Stearns &amp; Co was being carried out in the US by 1930. Writing in 1931, Hartung reported that in 1930 the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association had accepted synephrine for inclusion in its list of “New and Non-Official Remedies” as an agent for the treatment, by either oral or parenteral administration, \"of attacks of hay fever, asthma, coughing, spasms of asthma and pertussis (whooping cough).\" However, synephrine was dropped from the council's list in 1934, and its apparent re-advertising as a new drug by the Stearns company ten years later elicited a scathing comment from the Editors of the Journal of the American Medical Association. The third edition (1965) of <i>Drill's Pharmacology in Medicine</i> stated, with reservations, that synephrine was \"advertised as an antihistaminic to be used in the treatment of the common cold...\", under the trade name of \"Synephrin Tartrate\", and indicated that the dose was 100&#160;mg, given intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. Published in 1966, the <i>Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry</i> described synephrine (in the form of its racemic tartrate) as a sympathomimetic agent that was \"less effective than epinephrine\", and which had been used for the treatment of chronic hypotension, collapse due to shock, and other conditions leading to hypotension. In a later (1972) textbook, synephrine was described as a drug, sold in Europe, that was administered in situations involving shock, such as surgical or bacteremic shock, and spinal anesthesia-related shock. The recommended dose was given here as 25–50&#160;mg, by intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous administration. </p><p>There is no mention of synephrine in editions of <i>Drill's Pharmacology in Medicine</i> later than the 3rd, nor is there any reference to synephrine in the 2012 <i>Physicians' Desk Reference</i>, nor in the current FDA \"Orange Book\". </p><p>One current reference source describes synephrine as a vasoconstrictor that has been given to hypotensive patients, orally or by injection, in doses of 20–100&#160;mg. </p><p>One website from a healthcare media company, accessed in February, 2013, refers to oxedrine as being indicated for hypotensive states, in oral doses of 100–150&#160;mg tid, and as a \"conjunctival decongestant\" to be topically applied as a 0.5% solution. However, no supporting references are provided. </p> <p>There has been some confusion about the biological effects of synephrine because of the similarity of this un-prefixed name to the names <i>m-synephrine</i>, <i>Meta-synephrine</i> and <i>Neosynephrine</i>, all of which refer to a related drug and naturally occurring amine more commonly known as phenylephrine. Although there are chemical and pharmacological similarities between synephrine and phenylephrine, they are nevertheless different substances. The confusion is compounded by the fact that synephrine has been marketed as a drug under numerous different names, including <i>Sympatol</i>, <i>Sympathol</i>, <i>Synthenate</i>, and <i>oxedrine</i>, while phenylephrine has also been called <i>m-Sympatol</i>. The synephrine with which this article deals is sometimes referred to as <i>p-synephrine</i> in order to distinguish it from its positional isomers, <i>m</i>-synephrine and <i>o</i>-synephrine. A comprehensive listing of alternative names for synephrine may be found in the ChemSpider entry (see Chembox, at right). Confusion exists over the distinctions between <i>p</i>- and <i>m</i>-synephrine. However, an examination of the references cited in support of this statement show that all the evidence for the presence of <i>m</i>-synephrine in <i>C. aurantium</i> derives from a report by Penzak and co-workers, whose Abstract states that <i>m</i>-synephrine was found in <i>C. aurantium</i>, whereas a close reading of the text of the paper itself reveals that the authors (although apparently uncertain about which synephrine regio-isomer had been found in the plant by earlier investigators) were aware that their analytical technique could not distinguish between <i>m</i>- and <i>p</i>-synephrine, and did <i>not</i> claim that <i>m</i>-synephrine was present. Thus the Abstract is at variance with the experimental findings given in the full text of the paper, but this error has propagated through subsequent publications. Even the name \"<i>p</i>-synephrine\" is not unambiguous, since it does not specify stereochemistry. The only completely unambiguous names for synephrine are: (<i>R</i>)-(−)-4-[1-hydroxy-2-(methylamino)ethyl]phenol (for the l-enantiomer); (<i>S</i>)-(+)-4-[1-hydroxy-2-(methylamino)ethyl]phenol (for the d-enantiomer); and (<i>R</i>,<i>S</i>)-4-[1-hydroxy-2-(methylamino)ethyl]phenol (for the racemate, or d,l-synephrine) (see <a href=\"#Chemistry\">Chemistry</a> section). </p> <p>In terms of molecular structure, synephrine has a phenethylamine skeleton, with a phenolic hydroxy- group, an alcoholic hydroxy- group, and an <i>N</i>-methylated amino-group. Alternatively, synephrine might be described as a phenylethanolamine with an <i>N</i>-methyl and <i>p</i>-hydroxy substituent. The amino-group confers basic properties on the molecule, whereas the phenolic –OH group is weakly acidic: the apparent (see original article for discussion) pK<sub>a</sub>s for protonated synephrine are 9.55 (phenolic H) and 9.79 (ammonium H). </p><p>Common salts of racemic synephrine are its hydrochloride, C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>13</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>.HCl, m.p.&#160;150–152°, the oxalate (C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>13</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, m.p.&#160;221–222&#160;°C, and the tartrate (Sympatol), (C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>13</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, m.p.&#160;188–190&#160;°C. </p><p>The presence of the hydroxy-group on the benzylic C of the synephrine molecule creates a chiral center, so the compound exists in the form of two enantiomers, d- and l- synephrine, or as the racemic mixture, d,l- synephrine. The dextrorotatory d-isomer corresponds to the <a href=\"/wiki/Cahn%E2%80%93Ingold%E2%80%93Prelog_priority_rules\" title=\"Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules\">(<i>S</i>)-configuration</a>, and the levorotatory l-isomer to the <a href=\"/wiki/Cahn%E2%80%93Ingold%E2%80%93Prelog_priority_rules\" title=\"Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules\">(<i>R</i>)-configuration</a>. </p><p>Racemic synephrine has been resolved using ammonium 3-bromo-camphor-8-sulfonate. The enantiomers were not characterized as their free bases, but converted to the hydrochloride salts, with the following properties: </p><p>(<i>S</i>)-(+)-C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>13</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>.HCl: m.p.&#160;178&#160;°C; [α] = +42.0°, c 0.1 (H<sub>2</sub>O); (<i>R</i>)-(−)-C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>13</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>.HCl: m.p.&#160;176&#160;°C; [α] = −39.0°, c 0.2 (H<sub>2</sub>O) </p><p>(−)-Synephrine, as the free base isolated from a <i>Citrus</i> source, has m.p.&#160;162–164&#160;°C (with decomposition). </p><p>The X-ray structure for synephrine has been determined. </p> <p>Early and seemingly inefficient syntheses of synephrine were discussed by Priestley and Moness, writing in 1940. These chemists optimized a route beginning with the <i>O</i>-benzoylation of <i>p</i>-hydroxy-phenacyl chloride, followed by reaction of the resulting <i>O</i>-protected chloride with <i>N</i>-methyl-benzylamine to give an amino-ketone. This intermediate was then hydrolyzed with HCl/alcohol to the <i>p</i>-hydroxy-aminoketone, and the product then reduced catalytically to give (racemic) synephrine. </p><p>A later synthesis, due to Bergmann and Sulzbacher, began with the <i>O</i>-benzylation of <i>p</i>-hydroxy-benzaldehyde, followed by a Reformatskii reaction of the protected aldehyde with ethyl bromoacetate/Zn to give the expected β-hydroxy ester. This intermediate was converted to the corresponding acylhydrazide with hydrazine, then the acylhydrazide reacted with HNO<sub>2</sub>, ultimately yielding the <i>p</i>-benzyloxy-phenyloxazolidone. This was <i>N</i>-methylated using dimethyl sulfate, then hydrolyzed and <i>O</i>-debenzylated by heating with HCl, to give racemic synephrine. </p> <div><h3 >Structural relationships</h3><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Synephrine&action=edit&section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Structural relationships\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Much reference has been made in the literature (both lay and professional) of the structural kinship of synephrine with ephedrine, or with phenylephrine, often with the implication that the perceived similarities in structure should result in similarities in pharmacological properties. However, from a chemical perspective, synephrine is also related to a very large number of other drugs whose structures are based on the phenethylamine skeleton, and although some properties are common, others are not, making unqualified comparisons and generalizations inappropriate. </p><p>Thus, replacement of the <i>N</i>-methyl group in synephrine with a hydrogen atom gives octopamine; replacement of the β-hydroxy group in synephrine by a H atom gives <a href=\"/wiki/N-methyltyramine\" title=\"N-methyltyramine\"><i>N</i>-methyltyramine</a>; replacement of the synephrine phenolic 4-OH group by a –H gives halostachine. </p><p>If the synephrine phenolic 4-OH group is shifted to the <i>meta</i>-, or 3-position on the benzene ring, the compound known as phenylephrine (or <i>m</i>-synephrine, or \"Neo-synephrine\") results; if the same group is shifted to the <i>ortho</i>-, or 2-position on the ring, <i>o</i>-synephrine results. </p><p>Addition of another phenolic –OH group to the 3-position of the benzene ring produces the neurotransmitter epinephrine; addition of a methyl group to the α-position in the side-chain of synephrine gives oxilofrine (methylsynephrine). Four stereoisomers (two pairs of enantiomers) are possible for this substance. </p><p>Extension of the synephrine <i>N</i>-methyl substituent by one methylene unit to an <i>N</i>-ethyl gives the hypotensive experimental drug \"Sterling #573\"/\"Aethyl-Sympatol\". </p><p>The above structural relationships all involve a change at <i>one</i> position in the synephrine molecule, and numerous other similar changes, many of which have been explored, are possible. However, the structure of ephedrine differs from that of synephrine at <i>two</i> different positions: ephedrine has no substituent on the phenyl ring where synephrine has a 4-OH group, and ephedrine has a methyl group on the position α- to the N in the side-chain, where syneprine has only a H atom. Furthermore, \"synephrine\" exists as either of two enantiomers, while \"ephedrine\" exists as one of four different enantiomers; there are, in addition, racemic mixtures of these enantiomers. </p><p>The main differences of the synephrine isomers compared for example to the ephedrines are the hydroxy-substitutions on the benzene ring. Synephrines are direct sympathomimetic drugs while the ephedrines are both direct and indirect sympathomimetics. One of the main reasons for these differential effects is the obviously increased polarity of the hydroxy-substituted phenyl ethyl amines which renders them less able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier as illustrated in the examples for tyramine and the amphetamine analogs. </p> <p>Classical pharmacological studies on animals and isolated animal tissues showed that the principal actions of parenterally administered synephrine included raising blood-pressure, dilating the pupil, and constricting peripheral blood vessels. </p><p>There is now ample evidence that synephrine produces most of its biological effects by acting as an agonist (i.e. stimulating) at adrenergic receptors, with a distinct preference for the α<sub>1</sub> over the α<sub>2</sub> sub-type. However, the potency of synephrine at these receptors is relatively low (i.e. relatively large concentrations of the drug are required to activate them). The potency of synephrine at adrenergic receptors of the β-class (regardless of sub-type) is much lower than at α-receptors. There is some evidence that synephrine also has weak activity at 5-HT receptors, and that it interacts with TAAR1 (trace amine-associated receptor 1). </p><p>In common with virtually all other simple phenylethanolamines (β-hydroxy-phenethylamines), the (<i>R</i>)-(−)-, or l-, enantiomer of synephrine is more potent than the (<i>S</i>)-(+)-, or d-, enantiomer in most, but not all preparations studied. However, the majority of studies have been conducted with a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers. </p><p>Since the details regarding such variables as test species, receptor source, route of administration, drug concentration, and stereochemical composition are important but often incomplete in other Reviews and Abstracts of research publications, many are provided in the more technical review below, in order to support as fully as possible the broad statements made in this Synopsis. </p> <div><h3 >Pharmacology research</h3><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Synephrine&action=edit&section=15\" title=\"Edit section: Pharmacology research\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Pharmacological studies on synephrine date back to the late 1920s, when it was observed that injected synephrine raised blood pressure, constricted peripheral blood vessels, dilated pupils, stimulated the uterus, and relaxed the intestines in experimental animals. Representative of this early work is the paper by Tainter and Seidenfeld, who were the first researchers to systematically compare the different effects of the two synephrine enantiomers, d- and l- synephrine, as well as of the racemate, d,l-synephrine, in various animal assays. In experiments on anesthetized cats, Tainter and Seidenfeld confirmed earlier reports of the increase in blood pressure produced by intravenous doses of synephrine, showing that the median pressor doses for the isomers were: l-synephrine: 0.5&#160;mg/kg; d,l-synephrine: 1.0&#160;mg/kg; and d-synephrine: 2–20&#160;mg/kg. These effects lasted 2–3 minutes, peaking at ~30 seconds after administration. l-Synephrine was thus the more potent enantiomer, with about 1/60x the potency of the standard pressor l-epinephrine in the same assay. A later study, by Lands and Grant, showed that a dose of ~0.6&#160;mg/kg of racemic synephrine, given intravenously to anesthetized dogs, produced a rise in blood pressure of 34&#160;mmHg lasting 5–10 minutes, and estimated that this pressor activity was about 1/300x that of epinephrine. </p><p>Using cats and dogs, Tainter and Seidenfeld observed that neither d- nor l-synephrine caused any changes in the tone of normal bronchi, <i>in situ</i>, even at \"maximum\" doses. Furthermore, the marked brocho-constriction produced by injections of histamine was not reversed by either l-synephrine or d,l-synephrine. </p><p>In experiments with isolated sheep carotid artery, d-, l- and d,l-synephrine all showed some vasoconstrictor activity: l-synephrine was the most potent, producing strong contractions at a concentration of 1:10000. d-Synephrine was about 1/2 as potent as the l-isomer, but d,l-synephrine (which would have been expected to have a potency of 1/2 that of l-synephrine even if the d-isomer were completely inactive) did not produce significant and irregular contractions until a concentration of 1:2500had been reached, implying an inhibitory interaction between the two enantiomers. </p><p>Qualitatively similar results were obtained in a rabbit ear preparation: 25&#160;mg l-synephrine produced significant (50%) vasoconstriction, while the same concentration of d-synephrine elicited essentially no response. In contrast, d,l-synephrine did not produce any constriction up to 25&#160;mg, but 25 – 50&#160;mg caused a relaxation of the blood vessels, which again suggested that the d-isomer might be inhibiting the action of the l-isomer. </p><p>Experiments on strips of rabbit duodenum showed that l-synephrine caused a modest reduction in contractions at a concentration of 1:17000, but that the effects of the d- and d,l- forms were much weaker. </p><p>Racemic synephrine, given intramuscularly, or by instillation, was found to significantly reduce the inflammation caused by instillation of mustard oil into the eyes of rabbits. </p><p>Subcutaneous injection of racemic synephrine into rabbits was reported to cause a large rise in blood sugar. </p><p>In experiments on anesthetized cats, Papp and Szekeres found that synephrine (stereochemistry unspecified) raised the thresholds for auricular and ventricular fibrillation, an indication of anti-arrhythmic properties. </p><p>Evidence that synephrine might have some central effects comes from the research of Song and co-workers, who studied the effects of synephrine in mouse models of anti-depressant activity. These researchers observed that oral doses of 0.3 – 10&#160;mg/kg of racemic synephrine were effective in shortening the duration of immobility produced in the assays, but did not cause any changes in spontaneous motor activity in separate tests. This characteristic immobility could be counteracted by the pre-administration of prazosin. Subsequent experiments using the individual enanatiomers of synephrine revealed that although the d-isomer significantly reduced the duration of immobility in the tail suspension test, at an oral dose of 3&#160;mg/kg, the l-isomer had no effect at the same dose. In mice pre-treated with reserpine, an oral dose of 0.3&#160;mg/kg d-synephrine significantly reversed the hypothermia, while l-synephrine required a dose of 1&#160;mg/kg to be effective. Experiments with slices of cerebral cortex taken from rat brain showed that d-synephrine inhibited the uptake of [H]-norepinephrine with an IC<sub>50</sub> = 5.8 μM; l-synephrine was less potent (IC<sub>50</sub> = 13.5 μM). d-Synephrine also competitively inhibited the binding of nisoxetine to rat brain cortical slices, with a K<sub>i</sub> = 4.5 μM; l-synephrine was less potent (K<sub>i</sub> = 8.2 μM). In experiments on the release of [H]-norepinephrine from rat brain cortical slices, however, the l-isomer of synephrine was a more potent enhancer of the release (EC<sub>50</sub> = 8.2 μM) than the d-isomer (EC<sub>50</sub> = 12.3 μM). This enhanced release by l-synephrine was blocked by nisoxetine. </p><p>Burgen and Iversen, examining the effect of a broad range of phenethylamine-based drugs on [C]-norepinephrine-uptake in the isolated rat heart, observed that racemic synephrine was a relatively weak inhibitor (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.12 μM) of the uptake. </p><p>Another receptor-oriented study by Wikberg revealed that synephrine (stereochemistry unspecified) was a more potent agonist at guinea pig aorta α<sub>1</sub> receptors (pD<sub>2</sub> = 4.81) than at ileum α<sub>2</sub> receptors (pD<sub>2</sub> = 4.48), with a relative affinity ratio of α<sub>2</sub>/α<sub>1</sub> = 0.10. Although clearly indicating a selectivity of synephrine for α<sub>1</sub> receptors, its potency at this receptor sub-class is still relatively low, in comparison with that of phenylephrine (pD<sub>2</sub> at α<sub>1</sub> = 6.32). </p><p>Brown and co-workers examined the effects of the individual enantiomers of synephrine on α<sub>1</sub> receptors in rat aorta, and on α<sub>2</sub> receptors in rabbit saphenous vein. In the aorta preparation, l-synephrine gave a pD<sub>2</sub> = 5.38 (potency relative to norepinephrine = 1/1000), while d-synephrine had a pD<sub>2</sub> = 3.50 (potency relative to norepinephrine = 1/50000); in comparison, l-phenylephrine had pD<sub>2</sub> = 7.50 (potency relative to norepinephrine ≃ 1/6). No antagonism of norepinephrine was produced by concentrations of l-synephrine up to 10 M. In the rabbit saphenous assay, the pD<sub>2</sub> of l-synephrine was 4.36 (potency relative to norepinephrine ≃ 1/1700), and that of d-synephrine was &lt; 3.00; in comparison, l-phenylephrine had pD<sub>2</sub> = 5.45 (potency relative to norepinephrine ≃ 1/140). No antagonism of norepinephrine was produced by concentrations of l-synephrine up to 10 M. </p><p>A study of the effects of synephrine (stereochemistry unspecified) on strips of guinea pig aorta and on the field-stimulated guinea pig ileum showed that synephrine had an agonist potency of −logK<sub>a</sub> = 3.75 in the aorta assay. In comparison, epinephrine had a potency of −logK<sub>a</sub> = 5.70. There was no significant effect on the ileum at synephrine concentrations up to about 2 × 10 M, indicating selectivity for the α<sub>1</sub> receptor, but relatively low potency. </p><p>In binding experiments with central adrenergic receptors, using a preparation from rat cerebral cortex, l-synephrine had pIC<sub>50</sub> = 3.35, and d-synephrine had pIC<sub>50</sub> = 2.42 in competition against [H]-prazosin (standard α<sub>1</sub> ligand); against [H]-yohimbine (standard α<sub>2</sub> ligand), l-synephrine showed a pIC<sub>50</sub> = 5.01, and d-synephrine showed a pIC<sub>50</sub> = 4.17. </p><p>Experiments conducted by Hibino and co-workers also showed that synephrine (stereochemistry unspecified) produced a dose-dependent constriction of isolated rat aorta strips, in the concentration range 10–3 × 10 M. This constriction was found to be competitively antagonized by prazosin (a standard α<sub>1</sub> antagonist) and ketanserin, with prazosin being the more potent antagonist (pA<sub>2</sub> = 9.38, vs pA<sub>2</sub> = 8.23 for ketanserin). Synephrine constrictions were also antagonized by BRL-15,572, but not by SB-216,641 (used here as a selective 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> antagonist), or by propranolol (a common β antagonist). </p><p>In studies on guinea pig atria and trachea, Jordan and co-workers also found that synephrine had negligible activity on β<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>2</sub> receptors, being about 40000x less potent than norepinephrine. </p><p>Experiments with cultured white fat cells from several animal species, including human, by Carpéné and co-workers showed that racemic synephrine produced lipolytic effects, but only at high concentrations (0.1-1 mM). The potency, expressed in terms of pD<sub>2</sub> of synephrine in these species was as follows: rat: 4.38; hamster: 5.32; guinea pig: 4.31; human: 4.94. In comparison, isoprenaline had a pD<sub>2</sub> = 8.29 and norepinephrine had pD<sub>2</sub> = 6.80 in human white fat cells. The lipolytic effect of 1 mM/L of synephrine on rat white fat cells was antagonized by various β-antagonists with the following inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>): bupranolol: 0.11 μM; CGP-20,712A (β<sub>1</sub> antagonist): 6.09 μM; ICI-118,551 (β<sub>2</sub> antagonist): 3.58 μM; SR-5923A (β<sub>3</sub> antagonist): 17 μM. </p><p>The binding of racemic synephrine to cloned human adrenergic receptors has been examined: Ma and co-workers found that synephrine bound to α<sub>1A</sub>, α<sub>2A</sub> and α<sub>2C</sub> with low affinity (pK<sub>i</sub> = 4.11 for α<sub>1A</sub>; 4.44 for α<sub>2A</sub>; 4.61 for α<sub>2C</sub>). Synephrine behaved as a partial agonist at α<sub>1A</sub> receptors, but as an antagonist at α<sub>2A</sub> and α<sub>2C</sub> sub-types. </p><p>Racemic synephrine has been shown to be an agonist of the TAAR1, although its potency at the human TAAR1 is relatively low (EC<sub>50</sub> = 23700 nM; E<sub>max</sub> = 81.2%). </p> <p>The pharmacokinetics of synephrine were studied by Hengstmann and Aulepp, who reported a peak plasma concentration at 1–2 hours, with an elimination half-life (T<sub>1/2</sub>) of ~ 2 hours. </p> <p>Studies of the metabolism of synephrine by monoamine oxidases derived from rat brain mitochondria showed that synephrine was a substrate for deamination by both MAO-A and MAO-B, with K<sub>m</sub> = 250 μM and V<sub>max</sub> = 32.6 nM/mg protein/30 minutes; there was some evidence for preferential deamination by MAO-A. </p> <p>A number of studies of the effects of synephrine in humans, most of them focusing on its cardiovascular properties, have been performed since its introduction as a synthetic drug around 1930. The paper by Stockton and co-workers is representative, describing the effects of racemic synephrine in humans with particular attention to differences resulting from different routes of administration. Thus, it was shown by these investigators that <i>intramuscular</i> injections (average effective dose = 200&#160;mg) of the drug produced an increase in systolic blood pressure and pulse rate, without affecting the diastolic pressure. The blood pressure increase reached a maximum (~25&#160;mmHg) in 5 minutes following the injection, then gradually returned to normal over the course of 1 hour. Doses of drug greater than 200&#160;mg caused side-effects such as heart palpitations, headache, sweating, and feelings of apprehension. When given <i>intravenously</i>, doses of 25–50&#160;mg sufficed to produce a mean maximum increase in the blood pressure of 29&#160;mmHg in 2 minutes, and a return to baseline within 30 minutes. Respiration was generally not affected during these experiments. <i>Subcutaneous</i> administration of synephrine in doses ≤ 200&#160;mg had no effects on blood pressure or pulse rate. <i>Oral</i> doses of 500–1500&#160;mg of the drug did not affect blood pressure or respiration, but pulse rate was increased by ~12%, and the highest doses caused nausea and vomiting. </p><p>The i.m. administration of 75–500&#160;mg of synephrine did not relieve acute asthma attacks, contradicting an earlier claim. However, the topical application of 1–3% solutions of the drug to the nasal mucosa of patients with sinusitis did produce a beneficial constriction without local irritation. </p><p>Administration of synephrine by continuous intravenous infusion, at the rate of 4&#160;mg/minute, significantly increased mean arterial and systolic pressure, but diastolic pressure and heart rate were unaltered.; further details of this investigation are summarized in a review by Fugh-Berman and Myers. </p><p>There are a number of studies, references to many of which may be found in the review by Stohs and co-workers dealing with the effects produced by dietary supplements and herbal medications that contain synephrine as only one of many different chemical ingredients. These are outside the scope of the present article (see also the \"<a href=\"#Safety/Efficacy/Controversy\">Safety/Efficacy/Controversy</a>\" sub-section). </p> <p>The acute toxicities of racemic synephrine in different animals, reported in terms of \"maximum tolerated dose\" after s.c administration, were as follows: mouse: 300&#160;mg/kg; rat: 400&#160;mg/kg; guinea pig: 400&#160;mg/kg. \"Lethal doses\", given s.c., were found to be: mouse: 400&#160;mg/kg; rat: 500&#160;mg/kg; guinea pig: 500&#160;mg/kg. Another study of this compound, administered i.v. in mice, gave an LD<sub>50</sub> = 270&#160;mg/kg. </p><p>The \"subchronic toxicity\" of synephrine was judged to be low in mice, after administration of oral doses of 30 and 300&#160;mg/kg over a period of 28 days. Generally, this treatment did not result in significant alterations in biochemical or hematological parameters, nor in relative organ weights, but some changes were noted in glutathione (GSH) concentration, and in the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx). </p> <div><h2 >Safety/efficacy/controversy</h2><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Synephrine&action=edit&section=20\" title=\"Edit section: Safety/efficacy/controversy\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>There exists considerable controversy about the safety and/or efficacy of <i>synephrine-containing preparations</i>, which are often confused with synephrine alone, sometimes with <i>m</i>-synephrine. Furthermore, this body of literature deals with mixtures containing synephrine as only one of several biologically active components, even, in some cases, without explicit confirmation of the presence of synephrine. </p> <p>In insects, synephrine has been found to be a very potent agonist at many invertebrate octopamine receptor preparations, and is even more potent than octopamine at a locust (<i>Schistocerca americana gregaria</i>) nerve-muscle preparation. Synephrine (racemic) is also more potent than octopamine (racemic) at inducing light-emission in the firefly (<i>Photinus</i> species) light organ. Synephrine exhibits similarly high potency in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity and in decreasing clotting time in lobster (<i>Homarus americanus</i>) hematocytes. Racemic synephrine was found to increase cAMP in the abdominal epidermis of the blood-sucking bug, <i>Rhodnius prolixus</i>. Rachinsky reported that synephrine was equipotent with octopamine in stimulating JH (juvenile hormone) release in the corpora allata of honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>), but Woodring and Hoffmann found that synephrine had no effect on the synthesis of JH III, in <i>in vitro</i> preparations from the cricket, <i>Gryllus bimaculatus</i>. </p> <div><ol data-mw-group=\"lower-alpha\"> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">^</a></b> Synephrine does however not appear in the current FDA \"Orange Book\" or the 2012 <i>Physicians' Desk Reference</i>. </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-14\">^</a></b> About 1.0–0.02 mg/serving, based on a serving size of ~20g. </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-15\">^</a></b> About 1.0–0.1 mg/serving. </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-22\">^</a></b> Corresponding to roughly 1–15 mg/serving, assuming a 1-cup or 250 mL serving size. </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-68\">^</a></b> ~ 5 x 10M. </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-69\">^</a></b> ~ 2 x 10M. </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-70\">^</a></b> ~ 3 × 10M. </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-72\">^</a></b> Tail suspension and enforced swimming. </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-74\">^</a></b> Ostensibly correlated to anti-depressant activity. </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-75\">^</a></b> An adrenergic antagonist selective for α<sub>1</sub> receptors. </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-76\">^</a></b> Reversal of reserpine-induced hypothermia by a drug is a classical test for potential anti-depressant properties. </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-77\">^</a></b> A selective inhibitor of the norepinephrine transporter. </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-79\">^</a></b> Referred to here as \"oxedrine\". </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-84\">^</a></b> A drug often used as a selective 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> antagonist. </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-85\">^</a></b> Used here as a selective 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> antagonist. </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-88\">^</a></b> Used as a non-selective β-antagonist </li> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-103\">^</a></b> Referred to as \"Sympathol\". </li> </ol></div> <ul><li>Halostachine</li> <li>Deterenol</li> <li>Octopamine</li></ul> <div><ol> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b> <cite >SA, HCI Solutions. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200725033715/https://compendium.ch/fr/product/1092556-neo-synephrine-hcl-inj-los-10-mg-ml/mpro\">\"Neo-Synephrine HCl - compendium.ch\"</a>. <i>compendium.ch</i>.

This substance is present at very low concentrations in common foodstuffs such as [orange juice](/wiki/Orange_juice) and other orange (*[Citrus](/wiki/Citrus)* species) products, both of the \"sweet\" and \"bitter\" variety. The preparations used in [traditional Chinese medicine](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine) (**TCM**), also known as Zhi Shi (枳实), are the immature and dried whole oranges from *[Citrus aurantium](/wiki/Citrus_aurantium)* (*Fructus Aurantii Immaturus*). Extracts of the same material or purified synephrine are also marketed in the US, sometimes in combination with [caffeine](/wiki/Caffeine), as a weight-loss-promoting [dietary supplement](/wiki/Dietary_supplement) for oral consumption. While the traditional preparations have been in use for millennia as a component of TCM-formulas, synephrine itself is not an approved [over the counter drug](/wiki/Over_the_counter_drug). As a pharmaceutical, *m*-synephrine ([phenylephrine](/wiki/Phenylephrine)) is still used as a [sympathomimetic](/wiki/Sympathomimetic) (i.e. for its [hypertensive](/wiki/Hypertensive) and [vasoconstrictor](/wiki/Vasoconstrictor) properties), mostly by injection for the treatment of emergencies such as [shock](/wiki/Shock_(circulatory)), and rarely orally for the treatment of bronchial problems associated with [asthma](/wiki/Asthma) and [hay-fever](/wiki/Hay-fever).[[a]](#cite_note-2)\nThere is a difference between studies concerning synephrine as a single chemical entity (synephrine can exist in the form of either of two [stereoisomers](/wiki/Stereoisomers), d- and l-synephrine, which are chemically and pharmacologically distinct), and synephrine which is mixed with other drugs and/or botanical extracts in a \"supplement\", as well as synephrine which is present as only one chemical component in a naturally-occurring mixture of [phytochemicals](/wiki/Phytochemicals) such as the rind or fruit of a bitter orange. Mixtures containing synephrine as only one of their chemical components (regardless of whether these are of synthetic or natural origin) should not be assumed to produce exactly the same biological effects as synephrine alone.[[2]](#cite_note-3)\nIn physical appearance, synephrine is a colorless, crystalline solid and is water-soluble. Its molecular structure is based on a [phenethylamine](/wiki/Phenethylamine) skeleton and is related to those of many other drugs and to the major [neurotransmitters](/wiki/Neurotransmitters) epinephrine and norepinephrine.\n\n## Natural occurrences\n\nSynephrine, although already known as a synthetic [organic compound](/wiki/Organic_compound), was first isolated as a [natural product](/wiki/Natural_product) from the leaves of various *[Citrus](/wiki/Citrus)* trees, and its presence noted in different *Citrus* juices, by Stewart and co-workers in the early 1960s.[[3]](#cite_note-Stew-4)[[4]](#cite_note-Stew2-5) A survey of the distribution of synephrine amongst the higher plants was published in 1970 by Wheaton and Stewart.[[5]](#cite_note-6) It has subsequently been detected in *[Evodia](/wiki/Evodia)*[[6]](#cite_note-7) and *[Zanthoxylum](/wiki/Zanthoxylum)* species,[[7]](#cite_note-8) all plants of the family Rutaceae.\nTrace levels (0.003%) of synephrine have also been detected in the dried leaves of *[Pogostemon cablin](/wiki/Pogostemon_cablin)* ([patchouli](/wiki/Patchouli), Lamiaceae).[[8]](#cite_note-9) It is also found in certain cactus species of the genera *[Coryphantha](/wiki/Coryphantha)* and *[Dolichothele](/wiki/Dolichothele)*.[[9]](#cite_note-10)\nHowever, this compound is found predominantly in a number of *Citrus* species, including \"bitter\" orange varieties.\n\nExtracts of unripe fruit from Asian cultivars of *[Citrus aurantium](/wiki/Citrus_aurantium)* (commonly known as \"bitter\" orange), collected in China, were reported to contain synephrine levels of about 0.1–0.3%, or ~1–3&#160;mg/g;[[10]](#cite_note-11) Analysis of dried fruit of *C. aurantium* grown in Italy showed a concentration of synephrine of ~1&#160;mg/g, with peel containing over three times more than the pulp.[[11]](#cite_note-Pellat-12)\nSweet oranges of the Tarocco, Naveline and Navel varieties, bought on the Italian market, were found to contain ~13–34 μg/g (corresponding to 13–34&#160;mg/kg) synephrine (with roughly equal concentrations in juice and separated pulp); from these results, it was calculated that eating one \"average\" Tarocco orange would result in the consumption of ~6&#160;mg of synephrine.[[12]](#cite_note-Mat-13)\nAn analysis of 32 different orange \"jams\", originating mostly in the US and UK, but including samples from France, Italy, Spain, or Lebanon, showed synephrine levels ranging from 0.05&#160;mg/g–0.0009&#160;mg/g[[b]](#cite_note-14) in those jams made from bitter oranges, and levels of 0.05&#160;mg/g–0.006&#160;mg/g[[c]](#cite_note-15) of synephrine in jams made from sweet oranges.[[13]](#cite_note-Av-16)\nSynephrine has been found in [marmalade](/wiki/Marmalade) made from *[Citrus unshiu](/wiki/Citrus_unshiu)* (Satsuma mandarin)[[14]](#cite_note-XRef-17) obtained in Japan, at a concentration of ~0.12&#160;mg/g (or about 2.4&#160;mg/20g serving).[[15]](#cite_note-Kusu-18) Most of the orange marmalades made in the US are produced using \"sweet\" oranges (*[C. sinensis](/wiki/Citrus_sinensis)*), whereas \"bitter\" or Seville oranges (*C. aurantium*) are used for making the more traditional, bitterer marmalades in the United Kingdom.[[16]](#cite_note-Blum-19)\nA sample of commercial Japanese *C. unshiu* juice was found to contain ~0.36&#160;mg/g synephrine (or roughly 360&#160;mg/L),[[15]](#cite_note-Kusu-18) while in juice products obtained from a Satsuma mandarin variety grown in California, levels of synephrine ranged from 55 to 160&#160;mg/L .[[17]](#cite_note-20)\nJuices from \"sweet\" oranges purchased in Brazilian markets were found to contain ~10–22&#160;mg/L synephrine; commercial orange soft drinks obtained on the Brazilian market had an average synephrine content of ~1&#160;mg/L.[[18]](#cite_note-21) Commercial Italian orange juices contained ~13–32&#160;mg/L of synephrine[[12]](#cite_note-Mat-13)\nIn a survey of over 50 citrus fruit juices, either commercially-prepared or hand-squeezed from fresh fruit, obtained on the US market, Avula and co-workers found synephrine levels ranging from ~4–60&#160;mg/L;[[d]](#cite_note-22) no synephrine was detected in juices from grapefruit, lime, or lemon.[[13]](#cite_note-Av-16)\nAn analysis of the synephrine levels in a range of different citrus fruits, carried out on juices that had been extracted from fresh, peeled fruit, was reported by Uckoo and co-workers, with the following results:\nMarrs sweet orange (*C. sinensis* Tan.): ~85&#160;mg/L; Nova tangerine (*[C. reticulata](/wiki/Citrus_reticulata)* Tan.): ~78&#160;mg/L; clementine (*C. clementina* Tan.): ~115&#160;mg/L; Meyer lemon (*C. limon* Tan.) ~3&#160;mg/kg; Ugli tangelo (*C. reticulata* × *C. paradisi*) ~47&#160;mg/kg. No synephrine was detected in: Rio Red grapefruit (*C. paradisi* Macf.); Red-fleshed pummelo (*C. grandis* Tan.); or Wekiwa tangelo (*C. reticulata* × *C. paradisi*).[[14]](#cite_note-XRef-17)[[19]](#cite_note-23)\nNumerous additional comparable analyses of the synephrine content of *Citrus* fruits and products derived from them may be found in the research literature.\n\n### In humans and other animals\n\nLow levels of synephrine have been found in normal human urine,[[20]](#cite_note-Ib-24)[[21]](#cite_note-25) as well as in other mammalian tissue.[[22]](#cite_note-26)[[23]](#cite_note-27) To reduce the likelihood that the synephrine detected in urine had a dietary origin, the subjects tested by Ibrahim and co-workers abstained from the consumption of any citrus products for 48 hours prior to providing urine samples.[[20]](#cite_note-Ib-24)\nA 2006 study of synephrine in human [blood platelets](/wiki/Blood_platelets) by D'Andrea and co-workers showed increased levels in platelets from patients suffering from aura-associated migraine (0.72&#160;ng/108 platelets, compared to 0.33&#160;ng/108 platelets in control subjects).[[24]](#cite_note-28) Earlier, the same research group had reported a normal human [blood plasma](/wiki/Blood_plasma) level of synephrine of 0.90–13.69&#160;ng/mL.[[25]](#cite_note-Andrea-29)\n\nSince synephrine exists as either of two [enantiomers](/wiki/Enantiomers) (see Chemistry section below for further discussion), which do not produce identical biological effects (see Pharmacology section below) some researchers have examined the [stereoisomeric](/wiki/Stereoisomer) composition of synephrine extracted from natural sources. Although it seems clear that synephrine is found in those *Citrus* species which have been studied predominantly as the l-isomer,[[15]](#cite_note-Kusu-18)[[26]](#cite_note-Pel-30) low levels of d-synephrine have been detected in juice and marmalade made from *C. unshiu*,[[15]](#cite_note-Kusu-18) and low levels (0.002%) have been reported in fresh fruit from *C. aurantium*.[[26]](#cite_note-Pel-30) There are indications that some d-synephrine may be formed by the [racemization](/wiki/Racemization) of l-synephrine as a result of the processing of fresh fruit, although this matter has not been completely clarified.[[27]](#cite_note-31)[[28]](#cite_note-32) However, regardless of the situation in *Citrus* species, Ranieri and McLaughlin reported the *isolation* of [racemic](/wiki/Racemic) (i.e. a mixture of equal amounts of d- and l- stereoisomers) synephrine from a cactus of the genus *Dolichothele*, under conditions that would be unlikely to cause a significant amount of racemization.[[29]](#cite_note-33)\n\nThe biosynthesis of synephrine in *Citrus* species is believed to follow the pathway: [tyrosine](/wiki/Tyrosine) → [tyramine](/wiki/Tyramine) → [*N*-methyltyramine](/wiki/N-methyltyramine) → synephrine, involving the enzymes [tyrosine decarboxylase](/wiki/Tyrosine_decarboxylase) in the first step, [tyramine *N*-methyltransferase](/wiki/Tyramine_N-methyltransferase) in the second, and *N*-methyl-tyramine-β-hydroxylase in the third.[[30]](#cite_note-Wheat-34)[[31]](#cite_note-35) This pathway differs from that thought to occur in animals, involving [octopamine](/wiki/Octopamine): tyramine → octopamine → synephrine, where the conversion of tyramine to octopamine is mediated by [dopamine-β-hydroxylase](/wiki/Dopamine-%CE%B2-hydroxylase), and the conversion of octopamine to synephrine by [phenylethanolamine *N*-methyltransferase](/wiki/Phenylethanolamine_N-methyltransferase).[[25]](#cite_note-Andrea-29)[[30]](#cite_note-Wheat-34)\n\n## Presence in nutritional/dietary supplements\n\nSome dietary supplements, sold for the purposes of promoting weight-loss or providing energy, contain synephrine as one of several constituents. Usually, the synephrine is present as a natural component of *Citrus aurantium* (\"bitter orange\"), bound up in the plant matrix, but could also be of synthetic origin, or a purified phytochemical (i.e. extracted from a plant source and purified to chemical homogeneity).[[16]](#cite_note-Blum-19)[[35]](#cite_note-Sant-39)[[36]](#cite_note-40) The concentration range found by Santana and co-workers in five different supplements purchased in the US was about 5–14&#160;mg/g.[[35]](#cite_note-Sant-39)\n\nAs a synthetic drug, synephrine first appeared in Europe in the late 1920s, under the name of *Sympatol*. One of the earliest papers describing its pharmacological and toxicological properties was written by Lasch, who obtained it from the Viennese company Syngala.[[37]](#cite_note-Las-41) By 1930, *Sympatol* was referred to as a Boehringer product,[[38]](#cite_note-42) while one of the first US Patents describing its preparation and use was assigned to Frederick Stearns & Co. in 1933.[[39]](#cite_note-43) Despite the date of this patent, clinical and pharmacological research on synephrine obtained from Frederick Stearns & Co was being carried out in the US by 1930.[[40]](#cite_note-Stock-44)[[41]](#cite_note-Tain-45) Writing in 1931, Hartung reported that in 1930 the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association had accepted synephrine for inclusion in its list of “New and Non-Official Remedies” as an agent for the treatment, by either oral or parenteral administration, \"of attacks of hay fever, asthma, coughing, spasms of asthma and pertussis (whooping cough).\"[[42]](#cite_note-46)[[43]](#cite_note-Hart-47) However, synephrine was dropped from the council's list in 1934, and its apparent re-advertising as a new drug by the Stearns company ten years later elicited a scathing comment from the Editors of the Journal of the American Medical Association.[[44]](#cite_note-48) The third edition (1965) of *Drill's Pharmacology in Medicine* stated, with reservations, that synephrine was \"advertised as an antihistaminic to be used in the treatment of the common cold...\", under the trade name of \"Synephrin Tartrate\", and indicated that the dose was 100&#160;mg, given intramuscularly, or subcutaneously.[[45]](#cite_note-49) Published in 1966, the *Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry* described synephrine (in the form of its racemic tartrate) as a sympathomimetic agent that was \"less effective than epinephrine\", and which had been used  for the treatment of chronic [hypotension](/wiki/Hypotension), collapse due to shock, and other conditions leading to [hypotension](/wiki/Hypotension).[[46]](#cite_note-Wil-50) In a later (1972) textbook, synephrine was described as a drug, sold in Europe, that was administered in situations involving shock, such as surgical or [bacteremic](/wiki/Bacteremic) shock, and [spinal anesthesia](/wiki/Spinal_anesthesia)-related shock. The recommended dose was given here as 25–50&#160;mg, by intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous administration.[[47]](#cite_note-51)\nThere is no mention of synephrine in editions of *Drill's Pharmacology in Medicine* later than the 3rd, nor is there any reference to synephrine in the 2012 *[Physicians' Desk Reference](/wiki/Physicians%27_Desk_Reference)*, nor in the current [FDA](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) [\"Orange Book\"](/wiki/Approved_Drug_Products_with_Therapeutic_Equivalence_Evaluations).\nOne current reference source describes synephrine as a vasoconstrictor that has been given to hypotensive patients, orally or by injection, in doses of 20–100&#160;mg.[[48]](#cite_note-52)\nOne website from a healthcare media company, accessed in February, 2013, refers to oxedrine as being indicated for [hypotensive](/wiki/Hypotensive) states, in oral doses of 100–150&#160;mg [tid](/wiki/List_of_abbreviations_used_in_medical_prescriptions), and as a \"[conjunctival](/wiki/Conjunctiva) decongestant\" to be topically applied as a 0.5% solution.[[49]](#cite_note-53) However, no supporting references are provided.\n\nThere has been some confusion about the biological effects of synephrine because of the similarity of this un-prefixed name to the names *m-synephrine*, *Meta-synephrine* and *Neosynephrine*, all of which refer to a related drug and naturally occurring [amine](/wiki/Amine) more commonly known as [phenylephrine](/wiki/Phenylephrine). Although there are chemical and pharmacological similarities between synephrine and phenylephrine, they are nevertheless different substances. The confusion is compounded by the fact that synephrine has been marketed as a drug under numerous different names, including *Sympatol*, *Sympathol*, *Synthenate*, and *oxedrine*, while phenylephrine has also been called *m-Sympatol*. The synephrine with which this article deals is sometimes referred to as *p-synephrine* in order to distinguish it from its positional isomers, *m*-synephrine and *o*-synephrine. A comprehensive listing of alternative names for synephrine may be found in the ChemSpider entry (see Chembox, at right). Confusion exists over the distinctions between *p*- and *m*-synephrine.[[50]](#cite_note-G._Rossato,_V._M_2011-54) However, an examination of the references cited in support of this statement show that all the evidence for the presence of *m*-synephrine in *C. aurantium* derives from a report by Penzak and co-workers,[[51]](#cite_note-55) whose Abstract states that *m*-synephrine was found in *C. aurantium*, whereas a close reading of the text of the paper itself reveals that the authors (although apparently uncertain about which synephrine regio-isomer had been found in the plant by earlier investigators) were aware that their analytical technique could not distinguish between *m*- and *p*-synephrine, and did *not* claim that *m*-synephrine was present. Thus the Abstract is at variance with the experimental findings given in the full text of the paper, but this error has propagated through subsequent publications. Even the name \"*p*-synephrine\" is not unambiguous, since it does not specify stereochemistry. The only completely unambiguous names for synephrine are: (*R*)-(−)-4-[1-hydroxy-2-(methylamino)ethyl]phenol (for the l-enantiomer); (*S*)-(+)-4-[1-hydroxy-2-(methylamino)ethyl]phenol (for the d-enantiomer); and (*R*,*S*)-4-[1-hydroxy-2-(methylamino)ethyl]phenol (for the racemate, or d,l-synephrine) (see [Chemistry](#Chemistry) section).\n\nIn terms of molecular structure, synephrine has a [phenethylamine](/wiki/Phenethylamine) skeleton, with a [phenolic](/wiki/Phenol) [hydroxy](/wiki/Hydroxyl)- group, an [alcoholic](/wiki/Alcohol_(chemistry)) hydroxy- group, and an *N*-methylated [amino](/wiki/Amino)-group. Alternatively, synephrine might be described as a [phenylethanolamine](/wiki/Phenylethanolamine) with an *N*-methyl and *p*-hydroxy substituent. The amino-group confers basic properties on the molecule, whereas the phenolic –OH group is weakly acidic: the apparent (see original article for discussion) pKas for protonated synephrine are 9.55 (phenolic H) and 9.79 (ammonium H).[[52]](#cite_note-56)\nCommon salts of [racemic](/wiki/Racemic) synephrine are its [hydrochloride](/wiki/Hydrochloride), C9H13NO2.HCl, m.p.&#160;150–152°,[[53]](#cite_note-57) the [oxalate](/wiki/Oxalate) (C9H13NO2)2.C2H2O4, m.p.&#160;221–222&#160;°C,[[3]](#cite_note-Stew-4) and the [tartrate](/wiki/Tartrate) (Sympatol), (C9H13NO2)2.C4H6O6, m.p.&#160;188–190&#160;°C.[[46]](#cite_note-Wil-50)[[54]](#cite_note-58)\nThe presence of the hydroxy-group on the [benzylic](/wiki/Benzylic) C of the synephrine molecule creates a [chiral center](/wiki/Chiral_center), so the compound exists in the form of two [enantiomers](/wiki/Enantiomers), d- and l- synephrine, or as the [racemic mixture](/wiki/Racemic_mixture), d,l- synephrine. The [dextrorotatory](/wiki/Dextrorotatory) d-isomer corresponds to the [(*S*)-configuration](/wiki/Cahn%E2%80%93Ingold%E2%80%93Prelog_priority_rules), and the [levorotatory](/wiki/Levorotatory) l-isomer to the [(*R*)-configuration](/wiki/Cahn%E2%80%93Ingold%E2%80%93Prelog_priority_rules).[[55]](#cite_note-Midg-59)\nRacemic synephrine has been resolved using ammonium 3-bromo-camphor-8-sulfonate.[[11]](#cite_note-Pellat-12)[[55]](#cite_note-Midg-59) The enantiomers were not characterized as their free bases, but converted to the hydrochloride salts, with the following properties:[[55]](#cite_note-Midg-59)\n(*S*)-(+)-C9H13NO2.HCl: m.p.&#160;178&#160;°C; [α] = +42.0°, c 0.1 (H2O); (*R*)-(−)-C9H13NO2.HCl: m.p.&#160;176&#160;°C; [α] = −39.0°, c 0.2 (H2O)\n(−)-Synephrine, as the free base isolated from a *Citrus* source, has m.p.&#160;162–164&#160;°C (with decomposition).[[3]](#cite_note-Stew-4)[[4]](#cite_note-Stew2-5)[*[dead link](/wiki/Wikipedia:Link_rot)*]\nThe [X-ray structure](/wiki/X-ray_crystallography) for synephrine has been determined.[[55]](#cite_note-Midg-59)\n\nEarly and seemingly inefficient syntheses of synephrine were discussed by Priestley and Moness, writing in 1940.[[56]](#cite_note-60) These chemists optimized a route beginning with the *O*-benzoylation of *p*-hydroxy-phenacyl chloride, followed by reaction of the resulting *O*-protected chloride with *N*-methyl-benzylamine to give an amino-ketone. This intermediate was then hydrolyzed with HCl/alcohol to the *p*-hydroxy-aminoketone, and the product then reduced catalytically to give (racemic) synephrine.\nA later synthesis, due to Bergmann and Sulzbacher, began with the *O*-benzylation of *p*-hydroxy-benzaldehyde, followed by a [Reformatskii reaction](/wiki/Reformatsky_reaction) of the protected aldehyde with ethyl bromoacetate/Zn to give the expected β-hydroxy ester. This intermediate was converted to the corresponding acylhydrazide with hydrazine, then the acylhydrazide reacted with HNO2, ultimately yielding the *p*-benzyloxy-phenyloxazolidone. This was *N*-methylated using [dimethyl sulfate](/wiki/Dimethyl_sulfate), then hydrolyzed and *O*-debenzylated by heating with HCl, to give racemic synephrine.[[57]](#cite_note-61)\n\n### Structural relationships\n\nMuch reference has been made in the literature (both lay and professional) of the structural kinship of synephrine with [ephedrine](/wiki/Ephedrine), or with [phenylephrine](/wiki/Phenylephrine), often with the implication that the perceived similarities in structure should result in similarities in pharmacological properties. However, from a chemical perspective, synephrine is also related to a very large number of other drugs whose structures are based on the phenethylamine skeleton, and although some properties are common, others are not, making unqualified comparisons and generalizations inappropriate.\nThus, replacement of the *N*-[methyl](/wiki/Methyl) group in synephrine with a hydrogen atom gives [octopamine](/wiki/Octopamine); replacement of the β-[hydroxy](/wiki/Hydroxyl) group in synephrine by a H atom gives [*N*-methyltyramine](/wiki/N-methyltyramine); replacement of the synephrine [phenolic](/wiki/Phenol) 4-OH group by a –H gives [halostachine](/wiki/Halostachine).\nIf the synephrine phenolic 4-OH group is shifted to the *meta*-, or 3-position on the benzene ring, the compound known as phenylephrine (or *m*-synephrine, or \"Neo-synephrine\") results; if the same group is shifted to the *ortho*-, or 2-position on the ring, *o*-synephrine results.\nAddition of another phenolic –OH group to the 3-position of the benzene ring produces the [neurotransmitter](/wiki/Neurotransmitter) [epinephrine](/wiki/Epinephrine); addition of a [methyl](/wiki/Methyl) group to the α-position in the side-chain of synephrine gives [oxilofrine](/wiki/Oxilofrine) (methylsynephrine). Four stereoisomers (two pairs of enantiomers) are possible for this substance.\nExtension of the synephrine *N*-methyl substituent by one [methylene](/wiki/Methylene_bridge) unit to an *N*-[ethyl](/wiki/Ethyl_group) gives the [hypotensive](/wiki/Hypotensive) experimental drug \"Sterling #573\"/\"Aethyl-Sympatol\".[[58]](#cite_note-62)[[59]](#cite_note-63)\nThe above structural relationships all involve a change at *one* position in the synephrine molecule, and numerous other similar changes, many of which have been explored, are possible. However, the structure of ephedrine differs from that of synephrine at *two* different positions: ephedrine has no substituent on the phenyl ring where synephrine has a 4-OH group, and ephedrine has a methyl group on the position α- to the N in the side-chain, where syneprine has only a H atom. Furthermore, \"synephrine\" exists as either of two enantiomers, while \"ephedrine\" exists as one of four different enantiomers; there are, in addition, racemic mixtures of these enantiomers.\nThe main differences of the synephrine isomers compared for example to the [ephedrines](/wiki/Ephedrine) are the hydroxy-substitutions on the benzene ring. Synephrines are direct sympathomimetic drugs while the ephedrines are both direct and indirect sympathomimetics. One of the main reasons for these differential effects is the obviously increased polarity of the hydroxy-substituted phenyl ethyl amines which renders them less able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier as illustrated in the examples for tyramine and the amphetamine analogs.[[60]](#cite_note-64)\n\nClassical pharmacological studies on animals and isolated animal tissues showed that the principal actions of parenterally administered synephrine included raising blood-pressure, dilating the pupil, and constricting peripheral blood vessels.\nThere is now ample evidence(what evidence?) that synephrine produces most of its biological effects by acting as an [agonist](/wiki/Agonist) (i.e. stimulating) at adrenergic receptors, with a distinct preference for the α1 over the  α2 sub-type. However, the potency of synephrine at these receptors is relatively low (i.e. relatively large concentrations of the drug are required to activate them). The potency of synephrine at adrenergic receptors of the β-class (regardless of sub-type) is much lower than at α-receptors. There is some evidence that synephrine also has weak activity at [5-HT receptors](/wiki/5-HT_receptors), and that it interacts with [TAAR1](/wiki/TAAR1) (trace amine-associated receptor 1).\nIn common with virtually all other simple phenylethanolamines (β-hydroxy-phenethylamines), the (*R*)-(−)-, or l-, enantiomer of synephrine is more potent than the (*S*)-(+)-, or d-, enantiomer in most, but not all preparations studied. However, the majority of studies have been conducted with a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers.\nSince the details regarding such variables as test species, receptor source, route of administration, drug concentration, and stereochemical composition are important but often incomplete in other Reviews and Abstracts of research publications, many are provided in the more technical review below, in order to support as fully as possible the broad statements made in this Synopsis.\n\n### Pharmacology research\n\nPharmacological studies on synephrine date back to the late 1920s, when it was observed that injected synephrine raised blood pressure, constricted peripheral blood vessels, dilated pupils, stimulated the uterus, and relaxed the intestines in experimental animals.[[37]](#cite_note-Las-41)[[61]](#cite_note-65)[[62]](#cite_note-66) Representative of this early work is the paper by Tainter and Seidenfeld, who were the first researchers to systematically compare the different effects of the two synephrine enantiomers, d- and l- synephrine, as well as of the racemate, d,l-synephrine, in various animal assays.[[41]](#cite_note-Tain-45)\nIn experiments on anesthetized cats, Tainter and Seidenfeld confirmed earlier reports of the increase in blood pressure produced by intravenous doses of synephrine, showing that the median [pressor](/wiki/Pressor) doses for the isomers were: l-synephrine: 0.5&#160;mg/kg; d,l-synephrine: 1.0&#160;mg/kg; and d-synephrine: 2–20&#160;mg/kg. These effects lasted 2–3 minutes, peaking at ~30 seconds after administration. l-Synephrine was thus the more potent enantiomer, with about 1/60x the potency of the standard pressor l-epinephrine in the same assay.\nA later study, by Lands and Grant, showed that a dose of ~0.6&#160;mg/kg of racemic synephrine, given intravenously to anesthetized dogs, produced a rise in blood pressure of 34&#160;mmHg lasting 5–10 minutes, and estimated that this pressor activity was about 1/300x that of epinephrine.[[63]](#cite_note-Lands-67)\nUsing cats and dogs, Tainter and Seidenfeld observed that neither d- nor l-synephrine caused any changes in the tone of normal [bronchi](/wiki/Bronchi), *in situ*, even at \"maximum\" doses. Furthermore, the marked brocho-constriction produced by injections of [histamine](/wiki/Histamine) was not reversed by either l-synephrine  or d,l-synephrine.[[41]](#cite_note-Tain-45)\nIn experiments with isolated sheep [carotid](/wiki/Carotid) artery, d-, l- and d,l-synephrine all showed some [vasoconstrictor](/wiki/Vasoconstrictor) activity: l-synephrine was the most potent, producing strong contractions at a concentration of 1:10000.[[e]](#cite_note-68) d-Synephrine was about 1/2 as potent as the l-isomer, but d,l-synephrine (which would have been expected to have a potency of 1/2 that of l-synephrine even if the d-isomer were completely inactive) did not produce significant and irregular contractions until a concentration of 1:2500[[f]](#cite_note-69)had been reached, implying an inhibitory interaction between the two enantiomers.[[41]](#cite_note-Tain-45)\nQualitatively similar results were obtained in a rabbit ear preparation: 25&#160;mg l-synephrine produced significant (50%) vasoconstriction, while the same concentration of d-synephrine elicited essentially no response. In contrast, d,l-synephrine did not produce any constriction up to 25&#160;mg, but 25 – 50&#160;mg caused a relaxation of the blood vessels, which again suggested that the d-isomer might be inhibiting the action of the l-isomer.[[41]](#cite_note-Tain-45)\nExperiments on strips of rabbit [duodenum](/wiki/Duodenum) showed that l-synephrine caused a modest reduction in contractions at a concentration of 1:17000,[[g]](#cite_note-70) but that the effects of the d- and d,l- forms were much weaker.[[41]](#cite_note-Tain-45)\nRacemic synephrine, given intramuscularly, or by instillation, was found to significantly reduce the inflammation caused by instillation of [mustard oil](/wiki/Mustard_oil) into the eyes of rabbits.[[41]](#cite_note-Tain-45)\nSubcutaneous injection of racemic synephrine into rabbits was reported to cause a large rise in [blood sugar](/wiki/Blood_sugar).[[43]](#cite_note-Hart-47)\nIn experiments on anesthetized cats, Papp and Szekeres found that synephrine (stereochemistry unspecified) raised the thresholds for auricular and ventricular [fibrillation](/wiki/Fibrillation), an indication of [anti-arrhythmic](/wiki/Anti-arrhythmic) properties.[[64]](#cite_note-71)\nEvidence that synephrine might have some [central](/wiki/Central_nervous_system) effects comes from the research of Song and co-workers, who studied the effects of synephrine in mouse models[[h]](#cite_note-72) of anti-depressant activity.[[65]](#cite_note-73) These researchers observed that oral doses of 0.3 – 10&#160;mg/kg of racemic synephrine were effective in shortening the duration of immobility[[i]](#cite_note-74) produced in the assays, but did not cause any changes in spontaneous motor activity in separate tests. This characteristic immobility could be counteracted by the pre-administration of [prazosin](/wiki/Prazosin).[[j]](#cite_note-75)\nSubsequent experiments using the individual enanatiomers of synephrine revealed that although the d-isomer significantly reduced the duration of immobility in the tail suspension test, at an oral dose of 3&#160;mg/kg, the l-isomer had no effect at the same dose.\nIn mice pre-treated with [reserpine](/wiki/Reserpine),[[k]](#cite_note-76) an oral dose of 0.3&#160;mg/kg d-synephrine significantly reversed the [hypothermia](/wiki/Hypothermia), while l-synephrine required a dose of 1&#160;mg/kg to be effective.\nExperiments with slices of [cerebral cortex](/wiki/Cerebral_cortex) taken from rat brain showed that d-synephrine inhibited the uptake of [3H]-norepinephrine with an IC50 = 5.8 μM; l-synephrine was less potent (IC50 = 13.5 μM).\nd-Synephrine also competitively inhibited the binding of [nisoxetine](/wiki/Nisoxetine)[[l]](#cite_note-77) to rat brain cortical slices, with a Ki = 4.5 μM; l-synephrine was less potent (Ki = 8.2 μM).\nIn experiments on the release of [3H]-norepinephrine from rat brain cortical slices, however, the l-isomer of synephrine was a more potent enhancer of the release (EC50 = 8.2 μM) than the d-isomer (EC50 = 12.3 μM). This enhanced release by l-synephrine was blocked by nisoxetine.[[66]](#cite_note-78)\nBurgen and Iversen, examining the effect of a broad range of phenethylamine-based drugs on [14C]-norepinephrine-uptake in the isolated rat heart, observed that racemic synephrine[[m]](#cite_note-79) was a relatively weak inhibitor (IC50 = 0.12 μM) of the uptake.[[67]](#cite_note-80)\nAnother receptor-oriented study by Wikberg revealed that synephrine ([stereochemistry](/wiki/Stereochemistry) unspecified) was a more potent agonist at guinea pig [aorta](/wiki/Aorta) α1 receptors (pD2 = 4.81) than at [ileum](/wiki/Ileum) α2 receptors (pD2 = 4.48), with a relative affinity ratio of α2/α1 = 0.10. Although clearly indicating a selectivity of synephrine for α1 receptors, its potency at this receptor sub-class is still relatively low, in comparison with that of phenylephrine (pD2 at α1 = 6.32).[[68]](#cite_note-81)\nBrown and co-workers examined the effects of the individual enantiomers of synephrine on α1 receptors in rat [aorta](/wiki/Aorta), and on α2 receptors in rabbit [saphenous](/wiki/Great_saphenous_vein) vein. In the aorta preparation, l-synephrine gave a pD2 = 5.38 (potency relative to norepinephrine = 1/1000), while d-synephrine had a pD2 = 3.50 (potency relative to norepinephrine = 1/50000); in comparison, l-phenylephrine had pD2 = 7.50 (potency relative to norepinephrine ≃ 1/6). No antagonism of norepinephrine was produced by concentrations of l-synephrine up to 10−6 M. In the rabbit saphenous assay, the pD2 of l-synephrine was 4.36 (potency relative to norepinephrine ≃ 1/1700), and that of d-synephrine was < 3.00; in comparison, l-phenylephrine had pD2 = 5.45 (potency relative to norepinephrine ≃ 1/140). No antagonism of norepinephrine was produced by concentrations of l-synephrine up to 10−5 M.[[69]](#cite_note-Brown-82)\nA study of the effects of synephrine (stereochemistry unspecified) on strips of guinea pig aorta and on the field-stimulated guinea pig [ileum](/wiki/Ileum) showed that synephrine had an agonist potency of −logKa = 3.75 in the aorta assay. In comparison, epinephrine had a potency of −logKa = 5.70. There was no significant effect on the ileum at synephrine concentrations up to about 2 × 10−4 M, indicating selectivity for the α1 receptor, but relatively low potency.[[70]](#cite_note-83)\nIn binding experiments with central adrenergic receptors, using a preparation from rat cerebral cortex, l-synephrine had pIC50 = 3.35, and d-synephrine had pIC50 = 2.42 in competition against [3H]-[prazosin](/wiki/Prazosin) (standard α1 ligand); against [3H]-[yohimbine](/wiki/Yohimbine) (standard α2 ligand), l-synephrine showed a pIC50 = 5.01, and d-synephrine showed a pIC50 = 4.17.[[69]](#cite_note-Brown-82)\nExperiments conducted by Hibino and co-workers also showed that synephrine (stereochemistry unspecified) produced a dose-dependent constriction of isolated rat aorta strips, in the concentration range 10−5–3 × 10−6 M. This constriction was found to be competitively antagonized by prazosin (a standard α1 antagonist) and [ketanserin](/wiki/Ketanserin),[[n]](#cite_note-84) with prazosin being the more potent antagonist (pA2 = 9.38, vs pA2 = 8.23 for ketanserin). Synephrine constrictions were also antagonized by [BRL-15,572](/wiki/BRL-15,572),[[o]](#cite_note-85) but not by [SB-216,641](/wiki/SB-216,641) (used here as a selective 5-HT1B antagonist), or by [propranolol](/wiki/Propranolol) (a common β antagonist).[[71]](#cite_note-86)\nIn studies on guinea pig [atria](/wiki/Atrium_(heart)) and [trachea](/wiki/Vertebrate_trachea), Jordan and co-workers also found that synephrine had negligible activity on β1 and β2 receptors, being about 40000x less potent than norepinephrine.[[72]](#cite_note-87)\nExperiments with cultured [white fat cells](/wiki/Adipocytes) from several animal species, including human, by Carpéné and co-workers showed that racemic synephrine produced [lipolytic](/wiki/Lipolysis) effects, but only at high concentrations (0.1-1 mM). The potency, expressed in terms of pD2 of synephrine in these species was as follows: rat: 4.38; hamster: 5.32; guinea pig: 4.31; human: 4.94. In comparison, [isoprenaline](/wiki/Isoprenaline) had a pD2 = 8.29 and norepinephrine had pD2 = 6.80 in human white fat cells. The lipolytic effect of 1 mM/L of synephrine on rat white fat cells was antagonized by various β-antagonists with the following inhibitory concentrations (IC50): [bupranolol](/wiki/Bupranolol):[[p]](#cite_note-88) 0.11 μM; CGP-20,712A (β1 antagonist): 6.09 μM; ICI-118,551 (β2 antagonist): 3.58 μM; SR-5923A (β3 antagonist): 17 μM.[[73]](#cite_note-89)\nThe binding of racemic synephrine to cloned human adrenergic receptors has been examined: Ma and co-workers found that synephrine bound to α1A, α2A and α2C with low affinity (pKi = 4.11 for α1A; 4.44 for α2A; 4.61 for α2C). Synephrine behaved as a [partial agonist](/wiki/Partial_agonist) at α1A receptors, but as an antagonist at α2A and α2C sub-types.[[74]](#cite_note-90)\nRacemic synephrine has been shown to be an [agonist](/wiki/Agonist) of the [TAAR1](/wiki/Trace_amine-associated_receptor_1),[[75]](#cite_note-pmid15860375-91) although its potency at the human TAAR1 is relatively low (EC50 = 23700 nM; Emax = 81.2%).[[76]](#cite_note-92)\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of synephrine were studied by Hengstmann and Aulepp, who reported a peak plasma concentration at 1–2 hours, with an elimination half-life (T1/2) of ~ 2 hours.[[77]](#cite_note-93)\n\nStudies of the metabolism of synephrine by [monoamine oxidases](/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase) derived from rat brain [mitochondria](/wiki/Mitochondria) showed that synephrine was a substrate for [deamination](/wiki/Deamination) by both [MAO-A](/wiki/MAO-A) and [MAO-B](/wiki/MAO-B), with Km = 250 μM and Vmax = 32.6 nM/mg protein/30 minutes; there was some evidence for preferential deamination by MAO-A.[[78]](#cite_note-94)\n\nA number of studies of the effects of synephrine in humans, most of them focusing on its cardiovascular properties, have been performed since its introduction as a synthetic drug around 1930.[[40]](#cite_note-Stock-44)[[79]](#cite_note-95)[[80]](#cite_note-96)[[81]](#cite_note-97)[[82]](#cite_note-98)[[83]](#cite_note-Hoff-99) The paper by Stockton and co-workers is representative, describing the effects of racemic synephrine in humans with particular attention to differences resulting from different routes of administration. Thus, it was shown by these investigators that *intramuscular* injections (average effective dose = 200&#160;mg) of the drug produced an increase in [systolic](/wiki/Systole_(medicine)) blood pressure and pulse rate, without affecting the [diastolic](/wiki/Diastolic) pressure. The blood pressure increase reached a maximum (~25&#160;mmHg) in 5 minutes following the injection, then gradually returned to normal over the course of 1 hour. Doses of drug greater than 200&#160;mg caused side-effects such as heart palpitations, headache, sweating, and feelings of apprehension. When given *intravenously*, doses of 25–50&#160;mg sufficed to produce a mean maximum increase in the blood pressure of 29&#160;mmHg in 2 minutes, and a return to baseline within 30 minutes. Respiration was generally not affected during these experiments. *Subcutaneous* administration of synephrine in doses ≤ 200&#160;mg had no effects on blood pressure or pulse rate. *Oral* doses of 500–1500&#160;mg of the drug did not affect blood pressure or respiration, but pulse rate was increased by ~12%, and the highest doses caused nausea and vomiting.[[40]](#cite_note-Stock-44)\nThe i.m. administration of 75–500&#160;mg of synephrine did not relieve acute [asthma](/wiki/Asthma) attacks, contradicting an earlier claim.[[84]](#cite_note-100) However, the topical application of 1–3% solutions of the drug to the [nasal mucosa](/wiki/Mucous_membrane_of_nose) of patients with [sinusitis](/wiki/Sinusitis) did produce a beneficial constriction without local irritation.[[40]](#cite_note-Stock-44)\nAdministration of synephrine by continuous intravenous infusion, at the rate of 4&#160;mg/minute, significantly increased mean arterial and [systolic](/wiki/Systole_(medicine)) pressure, but [diastolic](/wiki/Diastole) pressure and heart rate were unaltered.;[[83]](#cite_note-Hoff-99) further details of this investigation are summarized in a review by Fugh-Berman and Myers.[[85]](#cite_note-101)\nThere are a number of studies, references to many of which may be found in the review by Stohs and co-workers[[86]](#cite_note-Stohs-102) dealing with the effects produced by dietary supplements and herbal medications that contain synephrine as only one of many different chemical ingredients. These are outside the scope of the present article (see also the \"[Safety/Efficacy/Controversy](#Safety/Efficacy/Controversy)\" sub-section).\n\nThe acute toxicities of racemic synephrine in different animals, reported in terms of \"maximum tolerated dose\" after s.c administration, were as  follows: mouse: 300&#160;mg/kg; rat: 400&#160;mg/kg; guinea pig: 400&#160;mg/kg. \"Lethal doses\", given s.c., were found to be: mouse: 400&#160;mg/kg; rat: 500&#160;mg/kg; guinea pig: 500&#160;mg/kg.[[37]](#cite_note-Las-41) Another study of this compound,[[q]](#cite_note-103) administered i.v. in mice, gave an LD50 = 270&#160;mg/kg.[[63]](#cite_note-Lands-67)\nThe \"subchronic toxicity\" of synephrine was judged to be low in mice, after administration of oral doses of 30 and 300&#160;mg/kg over a period of 28 days. Generally, this treatment did not result in significant alterations in biochemical or hematological parameters, nor in relative organ weights, but some changes were noted in [glutathione](/wiki/Glutathione) (GSH) concentration, and in the activity of [glutathione peroxidase](/wiki/Glutathione_peroxidase) (GPx).[[87]](#cite_note-104)\n\n## Safety/efficacy/controversy\n\nThere exists considerable controversy about the safety and/or efficacy of *synephrine-containing preparations*, which are often confused with synephrine alone, sometimes with *m*-synephrine.[[16]](#cite_note-Blum-19)[[50]](#cite_note-G._Rossato,_V._M_2011-54)[[86]](#cite_note-Stohs-102)[[88]](#cite_note-105)[[89]](#cite_note-106)[[90]](#cite_note-107)[[91]](#cite_note-108)[[92]](#cite_note-109)[[93]](#cite_note-110)[[94]](#cite_note-111)[[95]](#cite_note-112)[[96]](#cite_note-113) Furthermore, this body of literature deals with mixtures containing synephrine as only one of several biologically active components, even, in some cases, without explicit confirmation of the presence of synephrine.\n\nIn insects, synephrine has been found to be a very potent agonist at many invertebrate [octopamine](/wiki/Octopamine) receptor preparations, and is even more potent than octopamine at a [locust](/wiki/Locust) (*[Schistocerca](/wiki/Schistocerca) americana gregaria*) nerve-muscle preparation.[[97]](#cite_note-114) Synephrine (racemic) is also more potent than octopamine (racemic) at inducing light-emission in the [firefly](/wiki/Firefly) (*[Photinus](/wiki/Photinus)* species) light organ.[[98]](#cite_note-115) Synephrine exhibits similarly high potency in stimulating [adenylate cyclase](/wiki/Adenylate_cyclase) activity and in decreasing clotting time in [lobster](/wiki/Lobster) (*[Homarus americanus](/wiki/Homarus_americanus)*) hematocytes.[[99]](#cite_note-116) Racemic synephrine was found to increase [cAMP](/wiki/Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate) in the abdominal epidermis of the blood-sucking bug, *[Rhodnius prolixus](/wiki/Rhodnius_prolixus)*.[[100]](#cite_note-117) Rachinsky reported that synephrine was equipotent with octopamine in stimulating JH ([juvenile hormone](/wiki/Juvenile_hormone)) release in the [corpora allata](/wiki/Corpora_allata) of [honey bee](/wiki/Honey_bee) (*[Apis mellifera](/wiki/Apis_mellifera)*),[[101]](#cite_note-118) but Woodring and Hoffmann found that synephrine had no effect on the synthesis of [JH III](/wiki/Juvenile_hormone), in *in vitro* preparations from the cricket, *[Gryllus bimaculatus](/wiki/Gryllus_bimaculatus)*.[[102]](#cite_note-119)\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-2)** Synephrine does however not appear in the current FDA [\"Orange Book\"](/wiki/Approved_Drug_Products_with_Therapeutic_Equivalence_Evaluations) or the 2012 *[Physicians' Desk Reference](/wiki/Physicians%27_Desk_Reference)*.\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-14)** About 1.0–0.02 mg/serving, based on a serving size of ~20g.\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-15)** About 1.0–0.1 mg/serving.\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-22)** Corresponding to roughly 1–15 mg/serving, assuming a 1-cup or 250 mL serving size.\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-68)** ~ 5 x 10−4M.\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-69)** ~ 2 x 10−3M.\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-70)** ~ 3 × 10−4M.\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-72)** Tail suspension and enforced swimming.\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-74)** Ostensibly correlated to anti-depressant activity.\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-75)** An adrenergic antagonist selective for α1 receptors.\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-76)** Reversal of reserpine-induced hypothermia by a drug is a classical test for potential anti-depressant properties.\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-77)** A selective inhibitor of the [norepinephrine transporter](/wiki/Norepinephrine_transporter).\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-79)** Referred to here as \"oxedrine\".\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-84)** A drug often used as a selective 5-HT2A antagonist.\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-85)** Used here as a selective 5-HT1D antagonist.\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-88)** Used as a non-selective β-antagonist\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-103)** Referred to as \"Sympathol\".\n\n- [Halostachine](/wiki/Halostachine)\n\n- [Deterenol](/wiki/Deterenol)\n\n- [Octopamine](/wiki/Octopamine)\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-1)** SA, HCI Solutions.

These four molecules have some structural similarities. However, the structural and stereochemical differences of p-synephrine and p-octopamine as related to ephedrine and m-synephrine result in markedly different adrenergic receptor binding characteristics as well as other mechanistic differences which are reviewed. p-Synephrine and p-octopamine exhibit little binding to &#x3b1;-1, &#x3b1;-2, &#x3b2;-1 and &#x3b2;-2 adrenergic receptors, nor are they known to exhibit indirect actions leading to an increase in available levels of endogenous norepinephrine and epinephrine at commonly used doses. The relative absence of these mechanistic actions provides an explanation for their lack of production of cardiovascular effects at commonly used oral doses as compared to ephedrine and m-synephrine. As a consequence, the effects of ephedrine and m-synephrine cannot be directly extrapolated to p-synephrine and p-octopamine which exhibit significantly different pharmacokinetic, and physiological/pharmacological properties. These conclusions are supported by human, animal and in vitro studies that are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Following critical evaluation of the available literature to date, The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) position regarding caffeine intake is as follows: 1. Supplementation with caffeine has been shown to acutely enhance various aspects of exercise performance in many but not all studies. Small to moderate benefits of caffeine use include, but are not limited to: muscular endurance, movement velocity and muscular strength, sprinting, jumping, and throwing performance, as well as a wide range of aerobic and anaerobic sport-specific actions. 2. Aerobic endurance appears to be the form of exercise with the most consistent moderate-to-large benefits from caffeine use, although the magnitude of its effects differs between individuals. 3. Caffeine has consistently been shown to improve exercise performance when consumed in doses of 3-6&#x2009;mg/kg body mass. Minimal effective doses of caffeine currently remain unclear but they may be as low as 2&#x2009;mg/kg body mass. Very high doses of caffeine (e.g. 9&#x2009;mg/kg) are associated with a high incidence of side-effects and do not seem to be required to elicit an ergogenic effect. 4. The most commonly used timing of caffeine supplementation is 60&#x2009;min pre-exercise. Optimal timing of caffeine ingestion likely depends on the source of caffeine. For example, as compared to caffeine capsules, caffeine chewing gums may require a shorter waiting time from consumption to the start of the exercise session. 5. Caffeine appears to improve physical performance in both trained and untrained individuals. 6. Inter-individual differences in sport and exercise performance as well as adverse effects on sleep or feelings of anxiety following caffeine ingestion may be attributed to genetic variation associated with caffeine metabolism, and physical and psychological response. Other factors such as habitual caffeine intake also may play a role in between-individual response variation. 7. Caffeine has been shown to be ergogenic for cognitive function, including attention and vigilance, in most individuals. 8. Caffeine may improve cognitive and physical performance in some individuals under conditions of sleep deprivation. 9. The use of caffeine in conjunction with endurance exercise in the heat and at altitude is well supported when dosages range from 3 to 6&#x2009;mg/kg and 4-6&#x2009;mg/kg, respectively. 10. Alternative sources of caffeine such as caffeinated chewing gum, mouth rinses, energy gels and chews have been shown to improve performance, primarily in aerobic exercise. 11. Energy drinks and pre-workout supplements containing caffeine have been demonstrated to enhance both anaerobic and aerobic performance.",

Does caffeine dehydrate you at rest? 2. Does caffeine dehydrate you during exercise? 3. Does caffeine promote the loss of body fat? 4.

          "abstract": "Nutritional supplementation is a common practice among athletes, with creatine and caffeine among the most commonly used ergogenic aids. Hundreds of studies have investigated the ergogenic potential of creatine supplementation, with consistent improvements in strength and power reported for exercise bouts of short duration (&#x2264; 30 s) and high intensity. Caffeine has been shown to improve endurance exercise performance, but results are mixed in the context of strength and sprint performance. Further, there is conflicting evidence from studies comparing the ergogenic effects of coffee and caffeine anhydrous supplementation. Previous research has identified independent mechanisms by which creatine and caffeine may improve strength and sprint performance, leading to the formulation of multi-ingredient supplements containing both ingredients. Although scarce, research has suggested that caffeine ingestion may blunt the ergogenic effect of creatine. While a pharmacokinetic interaction is unlikely, authors have suggested that this effect may be explained by opposing effects on muscle relaxation time or gastrointestinal side effects from simultaneous consumption. The current review aims to evaluate the ergogenic potential of creatine and caffeine in the context of high-intensity exercise. Research directly comparing coffee and caffeine anhydrous is discussed, along with previous studies evaluating the concurrent supplementation of creatine and caffeine.",

Compared with its sedative and calming activities, the immunomodulatory effects of L-theanine have received less attention. Clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that L-theanine reduces immunosuppression caused by strenuous exercise and prevents colds and influenza by improving immunity. Numerous cell and animal studies have proven that theanine plays an immunoregulatory role in inflammation, nerve damage, the intestinal tract, and tumors by regulating &#x3b3;&#x3b4;T lymphocyte function, glutathione (GSH) synthesis, and the secretion of cytokines and neurotransmitters. In addition, theanine can be used as an immunomodulator in animal production. This article reviews the research progress of L-theanine on immunoregulation and related mechanisms, as well as its application in poultry and animal husbandry. It is hoped that this work will be beneficial to future related research.",

Its phosphorylated form, phosphocreatine, donates phosphate groups to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), turning it back into ATP. Creatine also acts as a buffer. It has the nominal formula (H<sub>2</sub>N)(HN)CN(CH<sub>3</sub>)CH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H and in solutions, exists in various tautomers, including a neutral form and zwitterionic forms. </p> <meta property=\"mw:PageProp/toc\"> <p>Creatine was first identified in 1832 when Michel Eugène Chevreul isolated it from the basified water-extract of skeletal muscle. He later named the crystallized precipitate after the Greek word for meat, κρέας</span> (<i><i lang=\"grc-Latn\">kreas</i></i>). In 1928, creatine was shown to exist in equilibrium with creatinine. Studies in the 1920s showed that consumption of large amounts of creatine did not result in its excretion. This result pointed to the ability of the body to store creatine, which in turn suggested its use as a dietary supplement. </p><p>In 1912, Harvard University researchers Otto Folin and Willey Glover Denis found evidence that ingesting creatine can dramatically boost the creatine content of the muscle. The discovery of phosphocreatine was reported in 1927. </p><p>In the 1960s, the enzyme creatine kinase (CK) was shown to phosphorylate ADP using phosphocreatine (PCr) to generate ATP. It follows that ATP - not PCr - is directly consumed in muscle contraction. CK uses creatine to buffer the ATP/ADP ratio. </p><p>While creatine's influence on physical performance has been well documented since the early twentieth century, it came into public view following the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. An August 7, 1992 article in <i>The Times</i> reported that Linford Christie, the gold medal winner at 100 meters, had used creatine before the Olympics (however, it should also be noted that Christie was found guilty of doping later in his career). An article in <i>Bodybuilding Monthly</i> named Sally Gunnell, who was the gold medalist in the 400-meter hurdles, as another creatine user.

The typical creatine content of skeletal muscle (as both creatine and phosphocreatine) is 120&#160;mmol per kilogram of dry muscle mass, but can reach up to 160&#160;mmol/kg through supplementation. Approximately 1–2% of intramuscular creatine is degraded per day and an individual would need about 1–3 grams of creatine per day to maintain average (unsupplemented) creatine storage. An omnivorous diet provides roughly half of this value, with the remainder synthesized in the liver and kidneys. </p> <p>Creatine is not an essential nutrient. It is an amino acid derivative, naturally produced in the human body from the amino acids glycine and arginine, with an additional requirement for <a href=\"/wiki/S-Adenosyl_methionine\" title=\"S-Adenosyl methionine\"><i>S</i>-adenosyl methionine</a> (a derivative of methionine) to catalyze the transformation of guanidinoacetate to creatine. In the first step of the biosynthesis, the enzyme arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://enzyme.expasy.org/EC/2.1.4.1\">EC:2.1.4.1</a>) mediates the reaction of glycine and arginine to form guanidinoacetate. This product is then methylated by <a href=\"/wiki/Guanidinoacetate_N-methyltransferase\" title=\"Guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase\">guanidinoacetate <i>N</i>-methyltransferase</a> (GAMT, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://enzyme.expasy.org/EC/2.1.1.2\">EC:2.1.1.2</a>), using <i>S</i>-adenosyl methionine as the methyl donor. Creatine itself can be phosphorylated by creatine kinase to form phosphocreatine, which is used as an energy buffer in skeletal muscles and the brain. A cyclic form of creatine, called creatinine, exists in equilibrium with its tautomer and with creatine. </p> <figure typeof=\"mw:File\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:CreatineSynthesis(en).png\"><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/CreatineSynthesis%28en%29.png/500px-CreatineSynthesis%28en%29.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"155\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/CreatineSynthesis%28en%29.png/960px-CreatineSynthesis%28en%29.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/CreatineSynthesis%28en%29.png/1000px-CreatineSynthesis%28en%29.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"2892\" data-file-height=\"898\"></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <div><h3 >Phosphocreatine system</h3><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Creatine&action=edit&section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Phosphocreatine system\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Creatine is transported through the blood and taken up by tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain and skeletal muscle, through an active transport system. The concentration of ATP in skeletal muscle is usually 2–5&#160;mM, which would result in a muscle contraction of only a few seconds. During times of increased energy demands, the phosphagen (or ATP/PCr) system rapidly resynthesizes ATP from ADP with the use of phosphocreatine (PCr) through a reversible reaction catalysed by the enzyme creatine kinase (CK). The phosphate group is attached to an NH center of the creatine. In skeletal muscle, PCr concentrations may reach 20–35&#160;mM or more. Additionally, in most muscles, the ATP regeneration capacity of CK is very high and is therefore not a limiting factor. Although the cellular concentrations of ATP are small, changes are difficult to detect because ATP is continuously and efficiently replenished from the large pools of PCr and CK. Creatine has the ability to increase muscle stores of PCr, potentially increasing the muscle's ability to resynthesize ATP from ADP to meet increased energy demands. </p><p>Creatine supplementation appears to increase the number of myonuclei that satellite cells will donate to damaged muscle fibers, which increases the potential for growth of those fibers. This increase in myonuclei probably stems from creatine's ability to increase levels of the myogenic transcription factor MRF4. </p> <div><h3 >Genetic deficiencies</h3><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Creatine&action=edit&section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Genetic deficiencies\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Genetic defects in the creatine biosynthetic pathway enzymes lead to various severe neurological defects. Defects in the two synthesis enzymes cause L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency. Both biosynthetic defects are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Creatine transporter defect, characterized by insufficient transport of creatine to the brain, is caused by mutations in <i>SLC6A8</i> and is inherited in an X-linked manner. </p> <div><h3 >Vegans and vegetarians</h3><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Creatine&action=edit&section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Vegans and vegetarians\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Vegan and vegetarian diets are associated with lower levels of muscle creatine, and athletes on these diets may benefit from creatine supplementation. </p> <p>Most of the research to-date on creatine has predominantly focused on the pharmacological properties of creatine, yet there is a lack of research into the pharmacokinetics of creatine. Studies have not established pharmacokinetic parameters for clinical usage of creatine such as volume of distribution, clearance, bioavailability, mean residence time, absorption rate, and half life. A clear pharmacokinetic profile would need to be established prior to optimal clinical dosing. </p> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Muscle_Total_Creatine_Stores.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Muscle_Total_Creatine_Stores.png/500px-Muscle_Total_Creatine_Stores.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"485\" height=\"272\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Muscle_Total_Creatine_Stores.png/960px-Muscle_Total_Creatine_Stores.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Muscle_Total_Creatine_Stores.png/970px-Muscle_Total_Creatine_Stores.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"1182\" data-file-height=\"664\"></a><figcaption>Approximate muscle total creatine levels in mmol/kg dry weight muscle reported in the literature for vegetarians, individuals following a normal diet, and in response to creatine loading with or without carbohydrate (CHO) or CHO and protein (PRO).

It has also been shown that taking a lower dose of 3 grams a day for 28 days can also increase total muscle creatine storage to the same amount as the rapid loading dose of 20 g/day for 6 days.

The greatest effect appears to be in individuals who are stressed (due, for instance, to sleep deprivation) or cognitively impaired. </p><p>A 2018 systematic review found that \"generally, there was evidence that short-term memory and intelligence/reasoning may be improved by creatine administration\", whereas for other cognitive domains \"the results were conflicting\". </p><p>A 2023 meta-analysis including 8 randomized controlled trials found that creatine supplementation improved memory performance with dosing parameters such as intake amounts and duration having no additional effects. Any positive effects on cognition from creatine supplementation seem to be greater for older adults. </p><p>A 2024 systematic review found no significant effect for healthy, unstressed individuals and mixed results for people under stress, suggesting that more research is needed to determine optimal dosing parameters and quantify changes in brain creatine levels during supplementation. </p><p>A 2024 randomized trial involving 15 sleep-deprived subjects found that a single large dose of creatine (0.35 g/kg) may partially restore cognitive performance and resolve aberrant brain metabolism parameters. </p><p>In a 2024 scientific opinion article, the European Food Safety Authority Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens determined that a cause and effect relationship cannot be established between creatine supplementation and increased cognitive function based on existing studies. In particular, it ruled that there is currently insufficient evidence on the mechanisms by which creatine can impact cognition. </p> <p>A meta-analysis found that creatine treatment increased muscle strength in muscular dystrophies, and potentially improved functional performance. Creatine treatment does not appear to improve muscle strength in people who have metabolic myopathies.

The studies assessed the use of various creatine-based compounds—such as creatine, creatine phosphate, and phosphocreatinine—administered via oral, intravenous, or intramuscular routes, typically as adjuncts to standard therapy. </p><p>The analysis found no conclusive evidence that creatine or its analogues significantly affect mortality, myocardial infarction progression, or ejection fraction. However, some studies suggested a potential improvement in cardiac dysrhythmias and dyspnoea. The trials varied considerably in terms of drug formulation, dosage, treatment duration, and patient populations. Notably, no studies were identified that examined the effects of these compounds in patients with essential hypertension. </p><p>Due to the small sample sizes, clinical heterogeneity, and inconsistent outcomes across trials, the authors concluded that more rigorous and larger-scale studies are necessary to establish the clinical utility of creatine analogues in cardiovascular care. </p> <p>It has been found that women who consumed ≥13 mg of creatine per kg of body mass daily have a lower risk of obstetric conditions. Creatines properties support energy for production, stabilization of maternal plasma creatine, improved pregnancy outcomes, as well as reduced oxidative stress. It was also found to reduce risk of preterm birth, support immune function, and reduce risk of perinatal brain injury. Perinatal brain injury occurs after hypoxia events, creatine allows cells to recover faster. </p> <p>Side effects include: </p> <ul><li>Weight gain due to extra water retention to the muscle</li> <li>Potential muscle cramps / strains / pulls</li> <li>Upset stomach</li> <li>Diarrhea</li></ul> <p>One well-documented effect of creatine supplementation is weight gain within the first week of the supplement schedule, likely attributable to greater water retention due to the increased muscle creatine concentrations by means of osmosis. </p><p>A 2009 systematic review discredited concerns that creatine supplementation could affect hydration status and heat tolerance and lead to muscle cramping and diarrhea. </p><p>Despite weight gain due to water retention and potential cramps being two seemingly \"common\" side effects, new research indicates that these side effects are likely not the result of creatine usage. In addition, the initial water retention is attributed to more short-term creatine use (the \"loading\" phase). Studies have shown that creatine usage does not necessarily affect total body water relative to muscle mass in the long-term. </p> <p>A 2019 systematic review published by the National Kidney Foundation investigated whether creatine supplementation had adverse effects on renal function. They identified 15 studies from 1997 to 2013 that looked at standard creatine loading and maintenance protocols of 4–20 g/day of creatine versus placebo. They utilized serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, and serum urea levels as a measure of renal damage. While in general creatine supplementation resulted in slightly elevated creatinine levels that remained within normal limits, supplementation did not induce renal damage (P value&lt; 0.001). Special populations included in the 2019 Systematic review included type 2 diabetic patients and post-menopausal women, bodybuilders, athletes, and resistance trained populations. The study also discussed 3 case studies where there were reports that creatine affected renal function. </p><p>In a joint statement between the American College of Sports Medicine, Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, and Dietitians in Canada on performance enhancing nutrition strategies, creatine was included in their list of ergogenic aids and they do not list renal function as a concern for use. </p><p>The most recent position stand on creatine from the <i>Journal of International Society of Sports Nutrition</i> states that creatine is safe to take in healthy populations from infants to the elderly to performance athletes. They also state that long term (5 years) use of creatine has been considered safe. </p> <p>A 2011 survey of 33 supplements commercially available in Italy found that over 50% of them exceeded the European Food Safety Authority recommendations in at least one contaminant. The most prevalent of these contaminants was creatinine, a breakdown product of creatine also produced by the body. Creatinine was present in higher concentrations than the European Food Safety Authority recommendations in 44% of the samples. About 15% of the samples had detectable levels of dihydro-1,3,5-triazine or a high dicyandiamide concentration. Heavy metals contamination was not found to be a concern, with only minor levels of mercury being detectable. Two studies reviewed in 2007 found no impurities. </p> <p>When creatine is mixed with protein and sugar at high temperatures (above 148&#160;°C), the resulting reaction produces carcinogenic heterocyclic amines (HCAs). Such a reaction happens when grilling or pan-frying meat. Creatine content (as a percentage of crude protein) can be used as an indicator of meat quality. </p> <div><h2 >Dietary considerations</h2><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Creatine&action=edit&section=28\" title=\"Edit section: Dietary considerations\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>Creatine-monohydrate is suitable for vegetarians and vegans, as the raw materials used for the production of the supplement have no animal origin. </p> <ul><li>Beta-Alanine</li> <li>Creatine methyl ester</li></ul> <div><ol> <li ><b><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">^</a></b> <cite >Stout JR, Antonio J, Kalman E, eds.

Its [phosphorylated](/wiki/Phosphorylated) form, [phosphocreatine](/wiki/Phosphocreatine), donates [phosphate groups](/wiki/Phosphate_group) to [adenosine diphosphate](/wiki/Adenosine_diphosphate) (ADP), turning it back into ATP. Creatine also acts as a [buffer](/wiki/Buffer_solution).[[2]](#cite_note-pmid26202197-2) It has the nominal formula (H2N)(HN)CN(CH3)CH2CO2H and in solutions, exists in various [tautomers](/wiki/Tautomer), including a neutral form and [zwitterionic](/wiki/Zwitterionic) forms.\n\nCreatine was first identified in 1832 when [Michel Eugène Chevreul](/wiki/Michel_Eug%C3%A8ne_Chevreul) isolated it from the basified water-extract of [skeletal muscle](/wiki/Skeletal_muscle). He later named the crystallized precipitate after the [Greek](/wiki/Ancient_Greek) word for meat, κρέας (*kreas*). In 1928, creatine was shown to exist in [equilibrium](/wiki/Tautomer) with [creatinine](/wiki/Creatinine).[[3]](#cite_note-3) Studies in the 1920s showed that consumption of large amounts of creatine did not result in its excretion. This result pointed to the ability of the body to store creatine, which in turn suggested its use as a dietary supplement.[[4]](#cite_note-4)\nIn 1912, [Harvard University](/wiki/Harvard_University) researchers [Otto Folin](/wiki/Otto_Folin) and [Willey Glover Denis](/wiki/Willey_Glover_Denis) found evidence that ingesting creatine can dramatically boost the creatine content of the muscle.[[5]](#cite_note-5)[[6]](#cite_note-6) The discovery of [phosphocreatine](/wiki/Phosphocreatine) was reported in 1927.[[7]](#cite_note-7)[[8]](#cite_note-8)\nIn the 1960s, the enzyme [creatine kinase](/wiki/Creatine_kinase) (CK) was shown to phosphorylate ADP using phosphocreatine (PCr) to generate ATP. It follows that ATP - not PCr - is directly consumed in muscle contraction. CK uses creatine to buffer the ATP/ADP ratio.[[9]](#cite_note-9)\nWhile creatine's influence on physical performance has been well documented since the early twentieth century, it came into public view following the [1992 Olympics](/wiki/1992_Summer_Olympics) in [Barcelona](/wiki/Barcelona). An August 7, 1992 article in *[The Times](/wiki/The_Times)* reported that [Linford Christie](/wiki/Linford_Christie), the gold medal winner at 100 meters, had used creatine before the Olympics (however, it should also be noted that Christie was found guilty of doping later in his career).[[10]](#cite_note-10) An article in *Bodybuilding Monthly* named [Sally Gunnell](/wiki/Sally_Gunnell), who was the gold medalist in the 400-meter hurdles, as another creatine user. In addition, *The Times* also noted that 100 meter hurdler [Colin Jackson](/wiki/Colin_Jackson) began taking creatine before the Olympics.[[11]](#cite_note-11)[[12]](#cite_note-12)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Phosphocreatine.svg/250px-Phosphocreatine.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Phosphocreatine.svg)[Phosphocreatine](/wiki/Phosphocreatine) relays phosphate to ADP.\nAt the time, low-potency creatine supplements were available in Britain, but creatine supplements designed for strength enhancement were not commercially available until 1993 when a company called [Experimental and Applied Sciences](/wiki/Experimental_and_Applied_Sciences) (EAS) introduced the compound to the sports nutrition market under the name *Phosphagen*.[[13]](#cite_note-13) In 1996, researchers found that carbohydrate consumption augments the effects of creatine supplementation on skeletal muscle creatine accumulation.[[14]](#cite_note-:4-14)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Creatinine-tautomerism-2D-skeletal.svg/250px-Creatinine-tautomerism-2D-skeletal.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Creatinine-tautomerism-2D-skeletal.svg)The cyclic derivative creatinine exists in equilibrium with its tautomer and with creatine.\n\nCreatine is a naturally occurring non-protein compound and the primary constituent of phosphocreatine, which is used to regenerate [ATP](/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate) within the cell. 95% of the human body's total creatine and phosphocreatine stores are found in skeletal muscle, while the remainder is distributed in the [blood](/wiki/Blood), brain, testes, and other tissues.[[15]](#cite_note-pmid22817979-15)[[16]](#cite_note-pmid26874700-16) The typical creatine content of skeletal muscle (as both creatine and phosphocreatine) is 120&#160;mmol per kilogram of dry muscle mass, but can reach up to 160&#160;mmol/kg through supplementation.[[17]](#cite_note-:2-17) Approximately 1–2% of intramuscular creatine is degraded per day and an individual would need about 1–3 grams of creatine per day to maintain average (unsupplemented) creatine storage.[[17]](#cite_note-:2-17)[[18]](#cite_note-18)[[19]](#cite_note-:5-19) An omnivorous diet provides roughly half of this value, with the remainder synthesized in the liver and kidneys.[[15]](#cite_note-pmid22817979-15)[[16]](#cite_note-pmid26874700-16)[[20]](#cite_note-pmid21387089-20)\n\nCreatine is not an [essential nutrient](/wiki/Essential_nutrient).[[21]](#cite_note-Creatine-21) It is an amino acid [derivative](/wiki/Derivative_(chemistry)), naturally produced in the human body from the [amino acids](/wiki/Amino_acid) [glycine](/wiki/Glycine) and [arginine](/wiki/Arginine), with an additional requirement for [*S*-adenosyl methionine](/wiki/S-Adenosyl_methionine) (a derivative of [methionine](/wiki/Methionine)) to catalyze the transformation of guanidinoacetate to creatine. In the first step of the [biosynthesis](/wiki/Biosynthesis), the [enzyme](/wiki/Enzyme) [arginine:glycine amidinotransferase](/wiki/Arginine:glycine_amidinotransferase) (AGAT, [EC:2.1.4.1](http://enzyme.expasy.org/EC/2.1.4.1)) mediates the reaction of glycine and arginine to form [guanidinoacetate](/wiki/Guanidinoacetate). This product is then [methylated](/wiki/Methylation) by [guanidinoacetate *N*-methyltransferase](/wiki/Guanidinoacetate_N-methyltransferase) (GAMT, [EC:2.1.1.2](http://enzyme.expasy.org/EC/2.1.1.2)), using *S*-adenosyl methionine as the methyl donor. Creatine itself can be [phosphorylated](/wiki/Phosphorylated) by [creatine kinase](/wiki/Creatine_kinase) to form [phosphocreatine](/wiki/Phosphocreatine), which is used as an energy buffer in skeletal muscles and the brain. A cyclic form of creatine, called [creatinine](/wiki/Creatinine), exists in equilibrium with its [tautomer](/wiki/Tautomer) and with creatine.\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/CreatineSynthesis%28en%29.png/500px-CreatineSynthesis%28en%29.png)](/wiki/File:CreatineSynthesis(en).png)\n### Phosphocreatine system\n\nCreatine is transported through the blood and taken up by tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain and skeletal muscle, through an active transport system. The concentration of [ATP](/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate) in skeletal muscle is usually 2–5&#160;mM, which would result in a muscle contraction of only a few seconds.[[22]](#cite_note-ncbi.nlm.nih.gov-22) During times of increased energy demands, the [phosphagen](/wiki/Phosphagen) (or ATP/PCr) system rapidly resynthesizes ATP from [ADP](/wiki/Adenosine_diphosphate) with the use of [phosphocreatine](/wiki/Phosphocreatine) (PCr) through a reversible reaction catalysed by the enzyme [creatine kinase](/wiki/Creatine_kinase) (CK). The phosphate group is attached to an NH center of the creatine. In skeletal muscle, PCr concentrations may reach 20–35&#160;mM or more. Additionally, in most muscles, the ATP regeneration capacity of CK is very high and is therefore not a limiting factor. Although the cellular concentrations of ATP are small, changes are difficult to detect because ATP is continuously and efficiently replenished from the large pools of PCr and CK.[[22]](#cite_note-ncbi.nlm.nih.gov-22) Creatine has the ability to increase muscle stores of PCr, potentially increasing the muscle's ability to resynthesize ATP from ADP to meet increased energy demands.[[23]](#cite_note-23)[[24]](#cite_note-24)[[25]](#cite_note-25)\nCreatine supplementation appears to increase the number of [myonuclei](/wiki/Myonuclei) that satellite cells will donate to damaged [muscle fibers](/wiki/Muscle_fiber), which increases the potential for growth of those fibers. This increase in myonuclei probably stems from creatine's ability to increase levels of the [myogenic transcription factor](/wiki/Myogenic_regulatory_factors) [MRF4](/wiki/MRF4).[[26]](#cite_note-26)\n\n### Genetic deficiencies\n\nGenetic defects in the creatine biosynthetic pathway enzymes lead to various severe neurological defects.[[27]](#cite_note-27) Defects in the two synthesis enzymes cause [L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency](/wiki/Arginine:glycine_amidinotransferase) and [guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency](/wiki/Guanidinoacetate_methyltransferase_deficiency). Both biosynthetic defects are inherited in an [autosomal recessive](/wiki/Autosomal_recessive) manner. [Creatine transporter defect](/wiki/Creatine_transporter_defect), characterized by insufficient transport of creatine to the brain, is caused by mutations in *[SLC6A8](/wiki/SLC6A8)* and is inherited in an [X-linked](/wiki/X-linked) manner.[[28]](#cite_note-creatinedefects-28)\n\n### Vegans and vegetarians\n\nVegan and vegetarian diets are associated with lower levels of muscle creatine, and athletes on these diets may benefit from creatine supplementation.[[29]](#cite_note-29)\n\nMost of the research to-date on creatine has predominantly focused on the pharmacological properties of creatine, yet there is a lack of research into the pharmacokinetics of creatine. Studies have not established pharmacokinetic parameters for clinical usage of creatine such as volume of distribution, clearance, bioavailability, mean residence time, absorption rate, and half life. A clear pharmacokinetic profile would need to be established prior to optimal clinical dosing.[[30]](#cite_note-30)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Muscle_Total_Creatine_Stores.png/500px-Muscle_Total_Creatine_Stores.png)](/wiki/File:Muscle_Total_Creatine_Stores.png)Approximate muscle total creatine levels in mmol/kg dry weight muscle reported in the literature for vegetarians, individuals following a normal diet, and in response to creatine loading with or without carbohydrate (CHO) or CHO and protein (PRO). Dietary supplementation of creatine serves to increase muscle creatine and PCr by 20–40%.\nAn approximation of 0.3 g/kg/day divided into 4 equal spaced intervals has been suggested since creatine needs may vary based on body weight.[[31]](#cite_note-:3-31)[[17]](#cite_note-:2-17) It has also been shown that taking a lower dose of 3 grams a day for 28 days can also increase total muscle creatine storage to the same amount as the rapid loading dose of 20 g/day for 6 days.[[17]](#cite_note-:2-17) However, a 28-day loading phase does not allow for [ergogenic](/wiki/Performance-enhancing_substance#Ergogenic_aids) benefits of creatine supplementation to be realized until fully saturated muscle storage.\nThis elevation in muscle creatine storage has been correlated with ergogenic benefits discussed in the research section. However, higher doses for longer periods of time are being studied to offset creatine synthesis deficiencies and mitigating diseases.[[32]](#cite_note-32)[[33]](#cite_note-33)[[28]](#cite_note-creatinedefects-28)\n\nAfter the 5–7 day loading phase, muscle creatine stores are fully saturated and supplementation only needs to cover the amount of creatine broken down per day. This maintenance dose was originally reported to be around 2–3 g/day (or 0.03 g/kg/day),[[17]](#cite_note-:2-17) however, some studies have suggested 3–5 g/day maintenance dose to maintain saturated muscle creatine.[[14]](#cite_note-:4-14)[[19]](#cite_note-:5-19)[[34]](#cite_note-34)[[35]](#cite_note-:6-35)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Plasma_creatine_concentration_over_time.jpg/250px-Plasma_creatine_concentration_over_time.jpg)](/wiki/File:Plasma_creatine_concentration_over_time.jpg)This graph shows the mean plasma creatine concentration (measured in μmol/L) over an 8-hour period following ingestion of 4.4&#160;grams of creatine in the form of creatine monohydrate (CrM), tri-creatine citrate (CrC), or creatine pyruvate (CrPyr).[[36]](#cite_note-pmid17997838-36)\nEndogenous serum or plasma creatine concentrations in healthy adults are normally in a range of 2–12&#160;mg/L. A single 5 gram (5000&#160;mg) oral dose in healthy adults results in a peak plasma creatine level of approximately 120&#160;mg/L at 1–2 hours post-ingestion. Creatine has a fairly short elimination half life, averaging just less than 3 hours, so to maintain an elevated plasma level it would be necessary to take small oral doses every 3–6 hours throughout the day.\n\nCreatine supplements are marketed in [ethyl ester](/wiki/Ethyl_ester), [gluconate](/wiki/Gluconate), [monohydrate](/wiki/Monohydrate), and [nitrate](/wiki/Nitrate) forms.[[37]](#cite_note-Cooper2012-37)\nCreatine supplementation for sporting performance enhancement is considered safe for short-term use but there is a lack of safety data for long term use, or for use in children and adolescents.[[38]](#cite_note-38)\nAccording to a 2018 [review article](/wiki/Review_article) in the *Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition* creatine monohydrate is the most effective nutritional supplement to increase high intensity exercise capacity and muscle mass during training.[[39]](#cite_note-39)\nCreatine use can increase maximum power and performance in high-intensity anaerobic repetitive work (periods of work and rest) by 5% to 15%.[[40]](#cite_note-40)[[41]](#cite_note-41)[[42]](#cite_note-42) Creatine supplementation exerts positive ergogenic effects on single and multiple bouts of short-duration, high-intensity exercise activities, in addition to potentiating exercise training adaptations.[[43]](#cite_note-43) Creatine has no significant effect on aerobic [endurance](/wiki/Endurance#Endurance_exercise).[[44]](#cite_note-44)[*[obsolete&#160;source](/wiki/Wikipedia:AGE_MATTERS)*][[45]](#cite_note-Graham-45)[*[obsolete&#160;source](/wiki/Wikipedia:AGE_MATTERS)*] \nA 2014 survey of 21,000 US college athletes showed that 14% of athletes take creatine supplements.[[46]](#cite_note-:1-46)\n\n### Cognitive performance\n\nCreatine is sometimes reported to have a beneficial effect on brain function and cognitive processing, although the evidence is difficult to interpret systematically and the appropriate dosing is unknown.[[47]](#cite_note-:8-47)[[48]](#cite_note-:9-48) The greatest effect appears to be in individuals who are [stressed](/wiki/Stress_(biology)) (due, for instance, to [sleep deprivation](/wiki/Sleep_deprivation)) or cognitively impaired.[[47]](#cite_note-:8-47)[[48]](#cite_note-:9-48)[[49]](#cite_note-49)\nA 2018 [systematic review](/wiki/Systematic_review) found that \"generally, there was evidence that short-term memory and intelligence/reasoning may be improved by creatine administration\", whereas for other cognitive domains \"the results were conflicting\".[[50]](#cite_note-50)\nA 2023 [meta-analysis](/wiki/Meta-analysis) including 8 [randomized controlled trials](/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial) found that creatine supplementation improved [memory](/wiki/Memory) performance with dosing parameters such as intake amounts and duration having no additional effects.[[51]](#cite_note-auto-51) Any positive effects on cognition from creatine supplementation seem to be greater for older adults.[[51]](#cite_note-auto-51)\nA 2024 [systematic review](/wiki/Systematic_review) found no significant effect for healthy, unstressed individuals and mixed results for people under stress, suggesting that more research is needed to determine optimal dosing parameters and quantify changes in brain creatine levels during supplementation.[[52]](#cite_note-52)\nA 2024 randomized trial involving 15 [sleep-deprived](/wiki/Sleep_deprivation) subjects found that a single large dose of creatine (0.35 g/kg) may partially restore cognitive performance and resolve aberrant brain metabolism parameters.[[53]](#cite_note-53)\nIn a 2024 scientific opinion article, the [European Food Safety Authority](/wiki/European_Food_Safety_Authority) Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens determined that a cause and effect relationship cannot be established between creatine supplementation and increased cognitive function based on existing studies.[[54]](#cite_note-54) In particular, it ruled that there is currently insufficient evidence on the mechanisms by which creatine can impact cognition.\n\nA meta-analysis found that creatine treatment increased muscle strength in [muscular dystrophies](/wiki/Muscular_dystrophies), and potentially improved functional performance.[[55]](#cite_note-Kley2013-55) Creatine treatment does not appear to improve muscle strength in people who have [metabolic myopathies](/wiki/Metabolic_myopathy).[[55]](#cite_note-Kley2013-55) High doses of creatine lead to increased muscle pain and an impairment in [activities of daily living](/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living) when taken by people who have [McArdle disease](/wiki/Glycogen_storage_disease_type_V).[[55]](#cite_note-Kley2013-55)\n\n### Mitochondrial diseases\n\n#### Parkinson's disease\n\nCreatine's impact on [mitochondrial](/wiki/Mitochondria) function has led to research on its efficacy and safety for slowing [Parkinson's disease](/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease). As of 2014, the evidence did not provide a reliable foundation for treatment decisions, due to risk of bias, small sample sizes, and the short duration of trials.[[56]](#cite_note-56)\n\n#### Huntington's disease\n\nSeveral primary studies[[57]](#cite_note-57)[[58]](#cite_note-58)[[59]](#cite_note-59) have been completed but no systematic review on [Huntington's disease](/wiki/Huntington%27s_disease) has been completed yet.\n\nIt is ineffective as a treatment for [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis](/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis).[[60]](#cite_note-60)\n\nA 2021 systemic review of studies found that \"the current body of evidence does not indicate that creatine supplementation increases [total testosterone](/wiki/Total_testosterone), [free testosterone](/wiki/Free_testosterone), [DHT](/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone) or causes hair loss/baldness\".[[61]](#cite_note-61)\n\n### Cardiovascular disease\n\nA 2011 systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of creatine and creatine analogues in adults with cardiovascular disease, including [heart failure](/wiki/Heart_failure) and [myocardial infarction](/wiki/Myocardial_infarction). The studies assessed the use of various creatine-based compounds—such as creatine, creatine phosphate, and [phosphocreatinine](/wiki/Phosphocreatine)—administered via oral, intravenous, or intramuscular routes, typically as adjuncts to standard therapy.\nThe analysis found no conclusive evidence that creatine or its analogues significantly affect mortality, myocardial infarction progression, or ejection fraction. However, some studies suggested a potential improvement in cardiac [dysrhythmias](/wiki/Arrhythmia) and [dyspnoea](/wiki/Shortness_of_breath). The trials varied considerably in terms of drug formulation, dosage, treatment duration, and patient populations. Notably, no studies were identified that examined the effects of these compounds in patients with essential hypertension.\nDue to the small sample sizes, clinical heterogeneity, and inconsistent outcomes across trials, the authors concluded that more rigorous and larger-scale studies are necessary to establish the clinical utility of creatine analogues in cardiovascular care.[[62]](#cite_note-62)\n\nIt has been found that women who consumed ≥13 mg of creatine per kg of body mass daily have a lower risk of obstetric conditions. Creatines properties support energy for production, stabilization of maternal plasma creatine, improved pregnancy outcomes, as well as reduced oxidative stress. It was also found to reduce risk of preterm birth, support immune function, and reduce risk of perinatal brain injury. Perinatal brain injury occurs after hypoxia events, creatine allows cells to recover faster.[[63]](#cite_note-63)\n\nSide effects include:[[64]](#cite_note-64)[[65]](#cite_note-65)\n\n- Weight gain due to extra [water retention](/wiki/Water_retention_(medicine)) to the muscle\n\n- Potential muscle cramps / strains / pulls\n\n- Upset stomach\n\n- [Diarrhea](/wiki/Diarrhea)\n\nOne well-documented effect of creatine supplementation is weight gain within the first week of the supplement schedule, likely attributable to greater water retention due to the increased muscle creatine concentrations by means of [osmosis](/wiki/Osmosis).[[66]](#cite_note-:0-66)\nA 2009 systematic review discredited concerns that creatine supplementation could affect hydration status and heat tolerance and lead to muscle cramping and diarrhea.[[67]](#cite_note-Lopez_RM,_Casa_DJ,_McDermott_BP,_Ganio_MS,_Armstrong_LE,_Maresh_CM_2009_215–23-67)[[68]](#cite_note-Dalbo_VJ,_Roberts_MD,_Stout_JR,_Kerksick_CM_2008_567–73-68)\nDespite weight gain due to water retention and potential cramps being two seemingly \"common\" side effects, new research indicates that these side effects are likely not the result of creatine usage. In addition, the initial water retention is attributed to more short-term creatine use (the \"loading\" phase). Studies have shown that creatine usage does not necessarily affect total body water relative to muscle mass in the long-term.[[69]](#cite_note-69)\n\nA 2019 systematic review published by the [National Kidney Foundation](/wiki/National_Kidney_Foundation) investigated whether creatine supplementation had adverse effects on renal function.[[70]](#cite_note-70) They identified 15 studies from 1997 to 2013 that looked at standard creatine loading and maintenance protocols of 4–20 g/day of creatine versus placebo. They utilized serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, and serum urea levels as a measure of renal damage. While in general creatine supplementation resulted in slightly elevated creatinine levels that remained within normal limits, supplementation did not induce renal damage (P value< 0.001). Special populations included in the 2019 Systematic review included type 2 diabetic patients[[71]](#cite_note-71) and post-menopausal women,[[72]](#cite_note-72) bodybuilders,[[73]](#cite_note-73) athletes,[[74]](#cite_note-74) and resistance trained populations.[[75]](#cite_note-75)[[76]](#cite_note-76)[[77]](#cite_note-77) The study also discussed 3 case studies where there were reports that creatine affected renal function.[[78]](#cite_note-78)[[79]](#cite_note-79)[[80]](#cite_note-80)\nIn a joint statement between the [American College of Sports Medicine](/wiki/American_College_of_Sports_Medicine), [Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics](/wiki/Academy_of_Nutrition_and_Dietetics), and Dietitians in Canada on performance enhancing nutrition strategies, creatine was included in their list of ergogenic aids and they do not list renal function as a concern for use.[[81]](#cite_note-:7-81)\nThe most recent position stand on creatine from the *Journal of International Society of Sports Nutrition* states that creatine is safe to take in healthy populations from infants to the elderly to performance athletes. They also state that long term (5 years) use of creatine has been considered safe.[[31]](#cite_note-:3-31)\n\nA 2011 survey of 33 supplements commercially available in Italy found that over 50% of them exceeded the [European Food Safety Authority](/wiki/European_Food_Safety_Authority) recommendations in at least one contaminant. The most prevalent of these contaminants was [creatinine](/wiki/Creatinine), a breakdown product of creatine also produced by the body.[[82]](#cite_note-82) Creatinine was present in higher concentrations than the [European Food Safety Authority](/wiki/European_Food_Safety_Authority) recommendations in 44% of the samples. About 15% of the samples had detectable levels of [dihydro-1,3,5-triazine](/wiki/1,3,5-Triazine) or a high [dicyandiamide](/wiki/Dicyandiamide) concentration. Heavy metals contamination was not found to be a concern, with only minor levels of mercury being detectable. Two studies reviewed in 2007 found no impurities.[[83]](#cite_note-ReferenceA-83)\n\nWhen creatine is mixed with protein and sugar at high temperatures (above 148&#160;°C), the resulting reaction produces carcinogenic [heterocyclic amines](/wiki/Heterocyclic_amine) (HCAs).[[84]](#cite_note-84) Such a reaction happens when grilling or pan-frying meat.[[85]](#cite_note-85) Creatine content (as a percentage of crude protein) can be used as an indicator of meat quality.[[86]](#cite_note-86)\n\n## Dietary considerations\n\nCreatine-monohydrate is suitable for vegetarians and vegans, as the raw materials used for the production of the supplement have no animal origin.[[87]](#cite_note-87)\n\n- [Beta-Alanine](/wiki/Beta-Alanine)\n\n- [Creatine methyl ester](/wiki/Creatine_methyl_ester)\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-1)** Stout JR, Antonio J, Kalman E, eds.

          "abstract": "Supplementing with creatine is very popular amongst athletes and exercising individuals for improving muscle mass, performance and recovery. Accumulating evidence also suggests that creatine supplementation produces a variety of beneficial effects in older and patient populations. Furthermore, evidence-based research shows that creatine supplementation is relatively well tolerated, especially at recommended dosages (i.e. 3-5 g/day or 0.1 g/kg of body mass/day). Although there are over 500 peer-refereed publications involving creatine supplementation, it is somewhat surprising that questions regarding the efficacy and safety of creatine still remain. These include, but are not limited to: 1. Does creatine lead to water retention? 2. Is creatine an anabolic steroid? 3. Does creatine cause kidney damage/renal dysfunction? 4. Does creatine cause hair loss / baldness? 5. Does creatine lead to dehydration and muscle cramping? 6. Is creatine harmful for children and adolescents? 7. Does creatine increase fat mass? 8. Is a creatine 'loading-phase' required? 9. Is creatine beneficial for older adults? 10. Is creatine only useful for resistance / power type activities? 11. Is creatine only effective for males? 12. Are other forms of creatine similar or superior to monohydrate and is creatine stable in solutions/beverages? To answer these questions, an internationally renowned team of research experts was formed to perform an evidence-based scientific evaluation of the literature regarding creatine supplementation.",

Preliminary studies indicate that creatine supplementation (and guanidinoacetic acid; GAA) has the ability to increase brain creatine content in humans. Furthermore, creatine has shown some promise for attenuating symptoms of concussion, mild traumatic brain injury and depression but its effect on neurodegenerative diseases appears to be lacking. The purpose of this narrative review is to summarize the current body of research pertaining to creatine supplementation on total creatine and phophorylcreatine (PCr) content, explore GAA as an alternative or adjunct to creatine supplementation on brain creatine uptake, assess the impact of creatine on cognition with a focus on sleep deprivation, discuss the effects of creatine supplementation on a variety of neurological and mental health conditions, and outline recent advances on creatine supplementation as a neuroprotective supplement following traumatic brain injury or concussion.",

          "abstract": "The consumption of oral creatine monohydrate has become increasingly common among professional and amateur athletes. Despite numerous publications on the ergogenic effects of this naturally occurring substance, there is little information on the possible adverse effects of this supplement. The objectives of this review are to identify the scientific facts and contrast them with reports in the news media, which have repeatedly emphasised the health risks of creatine supplementation and do not hesitate to draw broad conclusions from individual case reports. Exogenous creatine supplements are often consumed by athletes in amounts of up to 20 g/day for a few days, followed by 1 to 10 g/day for weeks, months and even years. Usually, consumers do not report any adverse effects, but body mass increases. There are few reports that creatine supplementation has protective effects in heart, muscle and neurological diseases. Gastrointestinal disturbances and muscle cramps have been reported occasionally in healthy individuals, but the effects are anecdotal. Liver and kidney dysfunction have also been suggested on the basis of small changes in markers of organ function and of occasional case reports, but well controlled studies on the adverse effects of exogenous creatine supplementation are almost nonexistent. We have investigated liver changes during medium term (4 weeks) creatine supplementation in young athletes. None showed any evidence of dysfunction on the basis of serum enzymes and urea production. Short term (5 days), medium term (9 weeks) and long term (up to 5 years) oral creatine supplementation has been studied in small cohorts of athletes whose kidney function was monitored by clearance methods and urine protein excretion rate. We did not find any adverse effects on renal function. The present review is not intended to reach conclusions on the effect of creatine supplementation on sport performance, but we believe that there is no evidence for deleterious effects in healthy individuals. Nevertheless, idiosyncratic effects may occur when large amounts of an exogenous substance containing an amino group are consumed, with the consequent increased load on the liver and kidneys. Regular monitoring is compulsory to avoid any abnormal reactions during oral creatine supplementation.",

          "abstract": "Due to the well-defined role of &#x3b2;-alanine as a substrate of carnosine (a major contributor to H+ buffering during high-intensity exercise), &#x3b2;-alanine is fast becoming a popular ergogenic aid to sports performance. There have been several recent qualitative review articles published on the topic, and here we present a preliminary quantitative review of the literature through a meta-analysis. A comprehensive search of the literature was employed to identify all studies suitable for inclusion in the analysis; strict exclusion criteria were also applied. Fifteen published manuscripts were included in the analysis, which reported the results of 57 measures within 23 exercise tests, using 18 supplementation regimes and a total of 360 participants [174, &#x3b2;-alanine supplementation group (BA) and 186, placebo supplementation group (Pla)]. BA improved (P=0.002) the outcome of exercise measures to a greater extent than Pla [median effect size (IQR): BA 0.374 (0.140-0.747), Pla 0.108 (-0.019 to 0.487)]. Some of that effect might be explained by the improvement (P=0.013) in exercise capacity with BA compared to Pla; no improvement was seen for exercise performance (P=0.204). In line with the purported mechanisms for an ergogenic effect of &#x3b2;-alanine supplementation, exercise lasting 60-240 s was improved (P=0.001) in BA compared to Pla, as was exercise of &gt;240 s (P=0.046). In contrast, there was no benefit of &#x3b2;-alanine on exercise lasting &lt;60 s (P=0.312). The median effect of &#x3b2;-alanine supplementation is a 2.85% (-0.37 to 10.49%) improvement in the outcome of an exercise measure, when a median total of 179 g of &#x3b2;-alanine is supplemented.",

          "abstract": "&#x3b2;-alanine supplementation has become a common practice among competitive athletes participating in a range of different sports. Although the mechanism by which chronic &#x3b2;-alanine supplementation could have an ergogenic effect is widely debated, the popular view is that &#x3b2;-alanine supplementation augments intramuscular carnosine content, leading to an increase in muscle buffer capacity, a delay in the onset of muscular fatigue, and a facilitated recovery during repeated bouts of high-intensity exercise. &#x3b2;-alanine supplementation appears to be most effective for exercise tasks that rely heavily on ATP synthesis from anaerobic glycolysis. However, research investigating its efficacy as an ergogenic aid remains equivocal, making it difficult to draw conclusions as to its effectiveness for training and competition. The aim of this review was to update, summarize, and critically evaluate the findings associated with &#x3b2;-alanine supplementation and exercise performance with the most recent research available to allow the development of practical recommendations for coaches and athletes. A critical review of the literature reveals that when significant ergogenic effects have been found, they have been generally shown in untrained individuals performing exercise bouts under laboratory conditions. The body of scientific data available concerning highly trained athletes performing single competition-like exercise tasks indicates that this type of population receives modest but potentially worthwhile performance benefits from &#x3b2;-alanine supplementation. Recent data indicate that athletes may not only be using &#x3b2;-alanine supplementation to enhance sports performance but also as a training aid to augment bouts of high-intensity training. &#x3b2;-alanine supplementation has also been shown to increase resistance training performance and training volume in team-sport athletes, which may allow for greater overload and superior adaptations compared with training alone. The ergogenic potential of &#x3b2;-alanine supplementation for elite athletes performing repeated high-intensity exercise bouts, either during training or during competition in sports which require repeated maximal efforts (e.g., rugby and soccer), needs scientific confirmation.",

          "abstract": "As a nitric oxide (NO) enhancer, citrulline malate (CM) has recently been touted as a potential ergogenic aid to both resistance and high-intensity exercise performance, as well as the recovery of muscular performance. The mechanism has been associated with enhanced blood flow to active musculature, however, it might be more far-reaching as either ammonia homeostasis could be improved, or ATP production could be increased via greater availability of malate. Moreover, CM might improve muscle recovery via increased nutrient delivery and/or removal of waste products. To date, a single acute 8&#xa0;g dose of CM on either resistance exercise performance or cycling has been the most common approach, which has produced equivocal results. This makes the effectiveness of CM to improve exercise performance difficult to determine. Reasons for the disparity in conclusions seem to be due to methodological discrepancies such as the testing protocols and the associated test-retest reliability, dosing strategy (i.e., amount and timing), and the recent discovery of quality control issues with some manufacturers stated (i.e., citrulline:malate ratios). Further exploration of the optimal dose is therefore required including quantification of the bioavailability of NO, citrulline, and malate following ingestion of a range of CM doses. Similarly, further well-controlled studies using highly repeatable exercise protocols with a large aerobic component are required to assess the mechanisms associated with this supplement appropriately. Until such studies are completed, the efficacy of CM supplementation to improve exercise performance remains ambiguous.",

J Strength Cond Res 34(5): 1480-1495, 2020-L-citrulline, a nonessential amino acid found primarily in watermelon, has recently garnered much attention for its potential to augment L-arginine bioavailability, nitric oxide production, and exercise performance. Over the past decade, L-citrulline has received considerable scientific attention examining potentially ergogenic properties for both aerobic and anaerobic exercise performance. Thus, the purpose of this article is to summarize the theoretical rationale behind L-citrulline supplementation and to comprehensively review the available scientific evidence assessing the potential ergogenic value of L-citrulline supplementation on vascular function and exercise performance in humans. In addition, research that has investigated the potential synergistic effects of L-citrulline with other dietary ingredients (e.g., arginine, antioxidants, nitrates, and branched-chain amino acids) is reviewed. Oral L-citrulline and citrulline malate supplementation have shown to increase plasma citrulline and arginine concentrations, along with total nitrate and nitrite concentrations. Although blood flow enhancement is a proposed mechanism for the ergogenic potential of L-citrulline, evidence supporting acute improvements in vasodilation and skeletal muscle tissue perfusion after supplementation is scarce and inconsistent. Nevertheless, several studies have reported that L-citrulline supplementation can enhance exercise performance and recovery. Given the positive effects observed from some investigations, future studies should continue to investigate the effects of both acute and chronic supplementation with L-citrulline and citrulline malate on markers of blood flow and exercise performance and should seek to elucidate the mechanism underlying such effects.",

          "abstract": "Nitric-oxide-stimulating dietary supplements are widely available and marketed to strength athletes and weightlifters seeking to increase muscle performance and augment training adaptations. These supplements contain ingredients classified as nitric oxide (NO) precursors (i.e., \"NO boosters\"). Endogenous NO is generated via a nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-dependent pathway and a NOS-independent pathway that rely on precursors including L-arginine and nitrates, with L-citrulline serving as an effective precursor of L-arginine. Nitric oxide plays a critical role in endothelial function, promoting relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and subsequent dilation which may favorably impact blood flow and augment mechanisms contributing to skeletal muscle performance, hypertrophy, and strength adaptations. The aim of this review is to describe the NO production pathways and summarize the current literature on the effects of supplementation with NO precursors for strength and power performance. The information will allow for an informed decision when considering the use of L-arginine, L-citrulline, and nitrates to improve muscular function by increasing NO bioavailability.",

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of Ashwagandha supplementation on anxiety as well as stress. A systematic search was performed in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar from inception until December 2021. We included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that investigate the effect of Ashwagandha extract on anxiety and stress. The overall effect size was pooled by random-effects model and the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CIs) for outcomes were applied. Overall, 12 eligible papers with a total sample size of 1,002 participants and age range between 25 and 48&#x2009;years were included in the current systematic review and meta-analysis. We found that Ashwagandha supplementation significantly reduced anxiety (SMD: -1.55, 95% CI: -2.37, -0.74; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.005; I2 &#xa0;=&#xa0;93.8%) and stress level (SMD: -1.75; 95% CI: -2.29, -1.22; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.005; I2 &#xa0;=&#xa0;83.1%) compared to the placebo. Additionally, the non-linear dose-response analysis indicated a favorable effect of Ashwagandha supplementation on anxiety until 12,000&#x2009;mg/d and stress at dose of 300-600&#x2009;mg/d. Finally, we identified that the certainty of the evidence was low for both outcomes. The current systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of RCTs revealed a beneficial effect in both stress and anxiety following Ashwagandha supplementation. However, further high-quality studies are needed to firmly establish the clinical efficacy of the plant.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether Rhodiola can be used as a supplement to improve human exercise ability. Studies were reviewed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines and conducted between August and November, 2021. Databases searched included Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed and East View Universal Database. Related terms were combined with keywords and MeSH subject headings using the corresponding Boolean operators: Rhodiola rosea, arctic root, roseroot, golden root, hongjingtian, and sports and exercise. A total of 10 papers were reviewed. Most of the studies reported that RR supplementation has a positive effect on athletic ability and sports performance, and no obvious adverse reactions were reported. Subjects taking RR showed a reduction in pain and muscle damage after exercise training, improved skeletal muscle damage, enhanced antioxidant capacity thereby reducing oxidative stress, reduced RPE scores, and improved athletic explosive power, but did not reduce the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scores. RR appears to act as a safe and effective supplementation for sport and exercise.",

Extracts from Panax ginseng, Eleutherococcus senticosus, Rhaponticum carthamoides, Rhodiola rosea, and Schisandra chinensis are considered to be naturally occurring adaptogens and, in particular, plant adaptogens. The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of plant adaptogens in the past and now, as well as to outline the prospects of their future applications. The use of natural adaptogens by humans has a rich history-they are used in recovery from illness, physical weakness, memory impairment, and other conditions. About 50 years ago, plant adaptogens were first used in professional sports due to their high potential to increase the body's resistance to stress and to improve physical endurance. Although now many people take plant adaptogens, the clinical trials on human are limited. The data from the meta-analysis showed that plant adaptogens could provide a number of benefits in the treatment of chronic fatigue, cognitive impairment, and immune protection. In the future, there is great potential to register medicinal products that contain plant adaptogens for therapeutic purposes.",

In total approximately 140 compounds were isolated from roots and rhizome - monoterpene alcohols and their glycosides, cyanogenic glycosides, aryl glycosides, phenylethanoids, phenylpropanoids and their glycosides, flavonoids, flavonlignans, proanthocyanidins and gallic acid derivatives. Studies on isolated organs, tissues, cells and enzymes have revealed that Rhodiola preparations exhibit adaptogenic effect including, neuroprotective, cardioprotectiv e, anti-fatigue, antidepressive, anxiolytic, nootropic, life-span increasing effects and CNS stimulating activity. A number of clinical trials demonstrate that repeated administration of R. rosea extract SHR-5 exerts an anti-fatigue effect that increases mental performance (particularly the ability to concentrate in healthy subjects), and reduces burnout in patients with fatigue syndrome. Encouraging results exist for the use of Rhodiola in mild to moderate depression, and generalized anxiety. Several mechanisms of action possibly contributing to the clinical effect have been identified for Rhodiola extracts. They include interactions with HPA-system (cortisol-reducing), protein kinases p-JNK, nitric oxide, and defense mechanism proteins (e.g. heat shock proteins Hsp 70 and FoxO/DAF-16). Lack of interaction with other drugs and adverse effects in the course of clinical trials make it potentially attractive for use as a safe medication. In conclusion, Rhodiola rosea has robust traditional and pharmacological evidence of use in fatigue, and emerging evidence supporting cognition and mood.",

          "abstract": "High-dose vitamin D supplementation can increase total osteocalcin concentrations that may reduce insulin resistance in individuals at risk for prediabetes or diabetes mellitus. Magnesium is a cofactor in vitamin D metabolism and activation. The purpose of this study was to determine the combined effect of vitamin D and magnesium supplementation on total osteocalcin concentrations, glycemic indices, and other bone turnover markers after a 12-week intervention in individuals who were overweight and obese, but otherwise healthy. We hypothesized that combined supplementation would improve serum total osteocalcin concentrations and glycemic indices more than vitamin D supplementation alone or a placebo. A total of 78 women and men completed this intervention in 3 groups: a vitamin D and magnesium group (1000 IU vitamin D3 and 360 mg magnesium glycinate), a vitamin D group (1000 IU vitamin D3), and a placebo group. Despite a significant increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in the vitamin D and magnesium group compared with the placebo group (difference&#xa0;=&#xa0;5.63; CI, -10.0 to -1.21; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.001) post-intervention, there were no differences in serum concentrations of total osteocalcin, glucose, insulin, and adiponectin or the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) among groups (P &gt; .05 for all). Additionally, total osteocalcin (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.310, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.081), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.004, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.986), and C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.426, P&#xa0;=&#xa0;.057), were not significant predictors of HOMA-IR after the intervention. Combined supplementation was not associated with short-term improvements in glycemic indices or bone turnover markers in participants who were overweight and obese in our study. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03134417).",

It is hypothesized that <i>H.&#160;erinaceus</i> can survive for 40 years. The mating system of <i>H.&#160;erinaceus</i> species found in the U.S. was shown to be bifactorially heterothallic. </p><p>The monokaryotic mycelium growth of <i>H.&#160;erinaceus</i> is slower than dikaryotic growth and only a relatively low percentage of monokaryotic cultures yield fruitbodies. Monokaryotic fruitbodies are also smaller than dikaryotic fruitbodies. The monokaryotic mycelium was found to produce fusoid to subglobose chlamydospores of 6–8 x 8–10&#160;μm size. These spores can stay viable for more than seven years and be stored under anaerobic conditions. Chlamydospore germination requires 30 to 52 hours, with a germination success rate of 32 to 54%. </p><p>Spore production is highest at midday, relative to temperature increase and a decrease of relative humidity. Daily trends toward lower relative humidity can favor sporulation, however, levels of relative humidity that are too low do not favor high total spore production. </p> <p><i>H. erinaceus</i> contains diverse phytochemicals, including polysaccharides, such as β-glucan, as well as hericenones and erinacines. From its essential oil, 77 aroma and flavor compounds were identified, including hexadecanoic acid (26% of total oil composition), linoleic acid (13%), phenylacetaldehyde (9%) and benzaldehyde (3%), and other oils, such as 2-methyl-3-furanthiol, 2-ethylpyrazine and 2,6-diethylpyrazine. Low concentrations of ergosterol are present. </p><p>Many of these compounds, particularly erinacines and hericenones, are able to readily cross the blood-brain barrier to increase their bioavailability in the brain. Erinacines have been shown to have effects on neuroprotection, antioxidant activity and neuroplasticity in the brain. </p> <p>Similar species in the genus include <i>H. americanum</i> and <i>H.&#160;coralloides</i>, both found in eastern North America. Additional species with a resemblance include <i>Donkia pulcherrima</i>, <i>Radulomyces copelandii</i> and some within <i>Sarcodontia</i>. </p> <div><h2 >Distribution and habitat</h2><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hericium_erinaceus&action=edit&section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Distribution and habitat\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>In Europe, the fruit bodies of <i>H.&#160;erinaceus</i> are mainly produced annually from August to November. In North America, they appear from October to February in the west, from July to October in the Mountain states, and from September to February in the east. </p><p>In the wild, lion's mane is usually associated with a tree wound and causes a white pocket rot. Decayed tissue becomes spongy and eventually disintegrates to form a cavity. The distinctive fruiting bodies (basidiocarps) generally appear near the edges of old wounds in autumn. It may be a tree parasite, possibly indicating an endophytic habitat. </p><p><i>H.&#160;erinaceus</i> hosts in North America include maple, ash, oaks, and eucalyptus. In California, lion's mane has been found on coast live oak, canyon live oak, interior live oak, California black oak, blue oak, and valley oak. </p><p>Lion's mane is able to withstand cold temperatures and frost conditions. </p> <p><i>Brennandania lambi</i> (Acari: <a href=\"https://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Pygmephoroidea\" title=\"species:Pygmephoroidea\">Pygmephoroidea</a>) is a mite pest of fungi culture in China. This mite can develop and reproduce on the mycelium of <i>H.&#160;erinaceus</i>. Farm hygiene and heat treatments are the most important pest management strategies that should be followed to counter this acarus. </p> <div><h3 >Competition with other fungi</h3><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hericium_erinaceus&action=edit&section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Competition with other fungi\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p><i>Hericium</i> species are good competitors against other wood colonisers. They show the ability to maintain their place on dead wood, also when confronted with secondary colonizers, such as <i>Trametes versicolor</i> and <i>Stereum hirsutum</i>. <i>Hericium erinaceus</i> has shown to be slightly more competitive than other fungi tooth species, including <i>Creolophus cirrhatus</i> and <i>H.&#160;coralloides</i>. </p> <p>Although <i>H. erinaceus</i> is native to Europe, it has been red listed in several European countries due to poor germination and establishment. </p> <p>In fungi cultivation, fungal strains are analogous to plant varieties in crop breeding. Fungal strains comprise clonal descendants of a single isolation from one fungal colony in a pure culture. The production of <i>H.&#160;erinaceus</i> is widespread in Asia, mostly using extensive production practices on wood logs or stumps. </p><p>Although there is considerable scientific research about <i>Hericium</i> spp., they are not commonly industrially produced in the West. Accordingly, there are few commercially available strains in the U.S. or Europe and little or no breeding for higher yield or other favorable traits has occurred. Production trials in Egypt report yields of <i>H.&#160;erinaceus</i> averaging at 165&#160;g per 1&#160;kg medium. </p><p>In North America, its production occurs only on a small scale. Most of it is intensive indoor production with only a few small outdoor sites where log cultivation is practiced. </p> <div><h3 >Substrate requirements</h3><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hericium_erinaceus&action=edit&section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Substrate requirements\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p>As a saprophyte that occurs on dead wood, <i>H.&#160;erinaceus</i> requires adequate substrate factors, including suitable carbon and nitrogen sources, a certain pH value and ideal carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. </p><p>Many different substrates have been used to successfully cultivate this mushroom. Depending on the type of cultivation, the substrate can be either solid (artificial log) or liquid (submerged culture and deep submerged culture). </p><p>The solid substrate is most commonly a mixture of sawdust of hardwood or conifer containing different complements that may include wheat bran, wheat straw, soybean meal, corn meal, rice bran, and rice straw. For example, <i>H.&#160;erinaceus</i> strains grow on beech sawdust substrate enriched with wheat bran (20%), rye grain (25%), soybean meal (7%), rapeseed meal (10%), or meat-osseous flour (6%). </p><p>An example of a liquid substrate composition can be glucose for the carbon source, soybean powder, corn powder, and wheat bran powder as a complex nitrogen source. The pH values most suitable for the favorable growth of <i>H. erinaceus</i> were in the range of 5.0–9.0, with pH 6.0 as optimal. </p> <div><h3 >Climate requirements</h3><p>[<a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hericium_erinaceus&action=edit&section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Climate requirements\">edit</a>]</span></p></div> <p><i>Hericium erinaceus</i> requires a humid environment for its growth: 85 to 90% of relative humidity in the air. The incubation temperature most suitable for the mycelial growth of <i>H. erinaceus</i> was found to be 25&#160;°C, and the optimum temperature for vegetative growth was 26&#160;°C. <i>H.&#160;erinaceus</i> is unable to grow with a water potential lower than -5 Mpa. </p> <p>The artificial cultivation of <i>H. erinaceus</i> was first reported in China in 1988. It is cultivated using artificial logs, bottles, and polypropylene bags. However, this type of artificial cultivation is not suitable for industrialized production due to its low yield and long cultivation cycles. </p><p>Submerged culture is a type of artificial cultivation of <i>H.&#160;erinaceus</i> whereby the fungus is grown in a liquid medium. Using this method, a large number of mycelia can be obtained quickly. Bioactive compounds can be sourced from the fruiting bodies, submerged-cultivated mycelial biomass, or liquid-cultivated broth. Growers optimize the culture medium composition to obtain simultaneously high yields of <i>H.&#160;erinaceus</i> mycelial biomass, exopolysaccharides, and polysaccharides. Submerged fermentation is preferable for the production of mycelial biomass and biologically active metabolites in order to produce a more uniform biomass and extract products. </p><p>Growth regulators, such as 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and gibberellin, were observed to have an advantageous effect on spore germination. Other technologies, such as red and green laser light of low intensity, stimulated spore germination as well as the vegetative growth of mycelium. Argon and helium lasers also contributed to the acceleration of fruit body development by 36–51%. </p> <p>Wild strains of <i>Hericium</i> spp. can be isolated and cultivated by first gathering fruiting bodies from fallen trees in the natural habitat. The fruiting bodies can then be opened to attain pieces of their inner spore-producing tissue. This tissue is then placed onto Petri dishes with agar to cultivate fungal colonies at 25&#160;°C. After several transfers to new Petri dishes to verify the purity of the strain, it can be kept at −80&#160;°C for long-term storage. </p> <figure typeof=\"mw:File/Thumb\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Beholder_-_June_2022_-_Sarah_Stierch_05.jpg\"><img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Beholder_-_June_2022_-_Sarah_Stierch_05.jpg/330px-Beholder_-_June_2022_-_Sarah_Stierch_05.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"232\" srcset=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Beholder_-_June_2022_-_Sarah_Stierch_05.jpg/500px-Beholder_-_June_2022_-_Sarah_Stierch_05.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Beholder_-_June_2022_-_Sarah_Stierch_05.jpg/960px-Beholder_-_June_2022_-_Sarah_Stierch_05.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"3761\" data-file-height=\"2905\"></a><figcaption>Rock cod with grilled <i>H.&#160;erinaceus</i></figcaption></figure> <p>The edible fruiting bodies are common in gourmet cooking, with young specimens considered the best.

It tends to grow in a single clump with dangling spines longer than 1 centimetre (1⁄2 inch). It can be mistaken for other *[Hericium](/wiki/Hericium)* species that grow in the same areas. \nNative to [North America](/wiki/North_America) and Eurasia, the mushrooms are common during late summer and autumn on [hardwoods](/wiki/Hardwoods), particularly [American beech](/wiki/American_beech) and [maple](/wiki/Maple). It is typically considered [saprophytic](/wiki/Saprophytic), as it mostly feeds on dead trees. It can also be found on living trees, usually in association with a wound.\nIt is an [edible mushroom](/wiki/Edible_mushroom) and used in [traditional Chinese medicine](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine). It is generally safe to eat, but its medicinal effectiveness, safety in supplements, and active compounds are unproven.\n\nBoth the Latin genus name *[Hericium](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Hericium#Latin)* and the species name *[erinaceus](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/erinaceus#Latin)* mean 'hedgehog' in [Latin](/wiki/Latin). This is also reflected by the [German](/wiki/German_language) name, *Igel-Stachelbart* (literally, 'hedgehog-goatee'), and some of its common English names, such as *bearded hedgehog* and *hedgehog mushroom*.[[3]](#cite_note-drugs-3) It is known in Japan as *yamabushitake* ([Kanji](/wiki/Kanji): 山伏茸, [Katakana](/wiki/Katakana): ヤマブシタケ) in reference to the [yamabushi](/wiki/Yamabushi) or mountain [ascetics](/wiki/Asceticism) of the [syncretistic](/wiki/Syncretism) religion known as [Shugendo](/wiki/Shugendo); while in [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language), it is known as *hóutóugū* ([simplified Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters): 猴头菇; [traditional Chinese](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters): 猴頭菇; [Jyutping](/wiki/Jyutping): *hau4 tou4 gu1*) meaning \"monkey-head mushroom\", in Korea as *noru gungdeng-i beoseot* (노루궁뎅이버섯) meaning \"[deer](/wiki/Siberian_roe_deer) butt mushroom\", and in Europe and the United States as *lion's mane*.[[4]](#cite_note-4)\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Lion%27s-mane_mushroom_imported_from_iNaturalist_photo_176790519_on_21_March_2024.jpg/250px-Lion%27s-mane_mushroom_imported_from_iNaturalist_photo_176790519_on_21_March_2024.jpg)](/wiki/File:Lion%27s-mane_mushroom_imported_from_iNaturalist_photo_176790519_on_21_March_2024.jpg)Specimen on living tree\nThe [fruit bodies](/wiki/Fruit_bodies) of *H. erinaceus* are large, irregular bulbous tubercules. They are 5–40 centimetres (2–15+1⁄2 inches) in diameter[[5]](#cite_note-Sokół-2016-5) and dominated by crowded, hanging, spore-producing spines, which are 1–5&#160;cm (1⁄2–2&#160;in) long or longer.[[6]](#cite_note-Wald-2004-6)[[7]](#cite_note-Davis-2012-7)\nThe hyphal system is [monomitic](/wiki/Monomitic), [amyloid](/wiki/Amyloid), and composed of thin- to thick-walled [hyphae](/wiki/Hypha) that are approximately 3–15&#160;[μm](/wiki/%CE%9Cm) (microns) wide. The hyphae also contain clamped [septa](/wiki/Septum) and [gloeoplerous](/wiki/Gloeoplerous) elements (filled with oily, resinous substances), which can come into the [hymenium](/wiki/Hymenium) as gloeocystidia.\nThe [basidia](/wiki/Basidia) are 25–40&#160;μm long and 5–7&#160;μm wide, contain four [spores](/wiki/Basidiospore) each and possess a basal clamp. The white amyloid spores measure approximately 5–7&#160;μm in length and 4–5&#160;μm in width. The spore shape is described as subglobose to short ellipsoid and the spore surface is smooth to finely roughened.[[5]](#cite_note-Sokół-2016-5)[[6]](#cite_note-Wald-2004-6)\n\nIt has been observed that *H.&#160;erinaceus* can fruit intermittently for 20 years on the same dead tree. It is hypothesized that *H.&#160;erinaceus* can survive for 40 years.[[5]](#cite_note-Sokół-2016-5) The mating system of *H.&#160;erinaceus* species found in the U.S. was shown to be [bifactorially heterothallic](/wiki/Mating_in_fungi).[[8]](#cite_note-Ginns-1985-8)\nThe [monokaryotic](/wiki/Dikaryotic) mycelium growth of *H.&#160;erinaceus* is slower than [dikaryotic](/wiki/Dikaryotic) growth and only a relatively low percentage of monokaryotic cultures yield fruitbodies. Monokaryotic fruitbodies are also smaller than dikaryotic fruitbodies.[[5]](#cite_note-Sokół-2016-5) The monokaryotic mycelium was found to produce fusoid to subglobose [chlamydospores](/wiki/Chlamydospore) of 6–8 x 8–10&#160;μm size. These spores can stay viable for more than seven years and be stored under anaerobic conditions.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] Chlamydospore germination requires 30 to 52 hours, with a germination success rate of 32 to 54%.[[8]](#cite_note-Ginns-1985-8)\nSpore production is highest at midday, relative to temperature increase and a decrease of relative humidity. Daily trends toward lower relative humidity can favor sporulation, however, levels of relative humidity that are too low do not favor high total spore production.[[9]](#cite_note-9)\n\n*H. erinaceus* contains diverse [phytochemicals](/wiki/Phytochemical), including [polysaccharides](/wiki/Polysaccharide), such as [β-glucan](/wiki/%CE%92-glucan), as well as [hericenones](/wiki/Hericenone) and [erinacines](/wiki/Erinacine).[[3]](#cite_note-drugs-3) From its [essential oil](/wiki/Essential_oil), 77 [aroma](/wiki/Aroma_compound) and flavor compounds were identified, including [hexadecanoic acid](/wiki/Hexadecanoic_acid) (26% of total oil composition), [linoleic acid](/wiki/Linoleic_acid) (13%), [phenylacetaldehyde](/wiki/Phenylacetaldehyde) (9%) and [benzaldehyde](/wiki/Benzaldehyde) (3%), and other oils, such as 2-methyl-3-furanthiol, 2-ethylpyrazine and 2,6-diethylpyrazine.[[10]](#cite_note-10) Low concentrations of [ergosterol](/wiki/Ergosterol) are present.[[3]](#cite_note-drugs-3)\nMany of these compounds, particularly [erinacines](/wiki/Erinacine) and [hericenones](/wiki/Hericenone), are able to readily cross the [blood-brain barrier](/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier) to increase their bioavailability in the brain. Erinacines have been shown to have effects on [neuroprotection](/wiki/Neuroprotection), [antioxidant](/wiki/Antioxidant) activity and [neuroplasticity](/wiki/Neuroplasticity) in the brain.[[11]](#cite_note-11)\n\nSimilar species in the genus include *[H. americanum](/wiki/Hericium_americanum)* and *[H.&#160;coralloides](/wiki/Hericium_coralloides)*,[[7]](#cite_note-Davis-2012-7) both found in eastern North America.[[12]](#cite_note-Cornell_Small_Farms-2015-12) Additional species with a resemblance include *[Donkia pulcherrima](/wiki/Donkia_pulcherrima)*, *[Radulomyces copelandii](/wiki/Radulomyces_copelandii)* and some within *[Sarcodontia](/wiki/Sarcodontia)*.[[13]](#cite_note-audu-13)\n\n## Distribution and habitat\n\nIn Europe, the fruit bodies of *H.&#160;erinaceus* are mainly produced annually from August to November.[[14]](#cite_note-14) In North America, they appear from October to February in the west, from July to October in the Mountain states, and from September to February in the east.[[13]](#cite_note-audu-13)\nIn the wild, lion's mane is usually associated with a tree wound and causes a [white pocket rot](/wiki/White_rot). Decayed tissue becomes spongy and eventually disintegrates to form a cavity. The distinctive fruiting bodies ([basidiocarps](/wiki/Basidiocarp)) generally appear near the edges of old wounds in autumn.[[15]](#cite_note-Swiecki-2006-15) It may be a tree [parasite](/wiki/Parasite), possibly indicating an [endophytic](/wiki/Endophytic) habitat.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] \n*H.&#160;erinaceus* hosts in North America include maple, ash, oaks, and eucalyptus.[[15]](#cite_note-Swiecki-2006-15) In California, lion's mane has been found on [coast live oak](/wiki/Quercus_agrifolia), [canyon live oak](/wiki/Quercus_chrysolepis), [interior live oak](/wiki/Quercus_wislizeni), [California black oak](/wiki/Quercus_kelloggii), [blue oak](/wiki/Quercus_douglasii), and [valley oak](/wiki/Quercus_lobata).[[15]](#cite_note-Swiecki-2006-15)\nLion's mane is able to withstand cold temperatures and frost conditions.[[16]](#cite_note-Boddy-2011-16)\n\n*Brennandania lambi* ([Acari](/wiki/Acari): [Pygmephoroidea](https://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Pygmephoroidea)) is a mite pest of fungi culture in China. This mite can develop and reproduce on the mycelium of *H.&#160;erinaceus*. Farm hygiene and heat treatments are the most important pest management strategies that should be followed to counter this acarus.[[17]](#cite_note-17)\n\n### Competition with other fungi\n\n*Hericium* species are good competitors against other wood colonisers. They show the ability to maintain their place on dead wood, also when confronted with secondary colonizers, such as *[Trametes versicolor](/wiki/Trametes_versicolor)* and *[Stereum hirsutum](/wiki/Stereum_hirsutum)*.[[5]](#cite_note-Sokół-2016-5) *Hericium erinaceus* has shown to be slightly more competitive than other fungi tooth species, including *[Creolophus cirrhatus](/wiki/Creolophus_cirrhatus)* and *H.&#160;coralloides*.[[18]](#cite_note-18)\n\nAlthough *H. erinaceus* is native to Europe, it has been [red listed](/wiki/IUCN_Red_List) in several European countries due to poor [germination](/wiki/Germination) and establishment.[[19]](#cite_note-19)\n\nIn fungi cultivation, fungal [strains](/wiki/Strain_(biology)) are analogous to plant varieties in crop breeding.[[12]](#cite_note-Cornell_Small_Farms-2015-12) Fungal strains comprise clonal descendants of a single isolation from one fungal colony in a pure culture.[[20]](#cite_note-20) The production of *H.&#160;erinaceus* is widespread in Asia, mostly using extensive production practices on wood logs or stumps.[[3]](#cite_note-drugs-3)\nAlthough there is considerable scientific research about *Hericium* spp., they are not commonly industrially produced in the West. Accordingly, there are few commercially available strains in the U.S. or Europe and little or no breeding for higher yield or other favorable traits has occurred.[[12]](#cite_note-Cornell_Small_Farms-2015-12)  Production trials in Egypt report yields of *H.&#160;erinaceus* averaging at 165&#160;g per 1&#160;kg medium.[[21]](#cite_note-Hassan-2007-21)\nIn North America, its production occurs only on a small scale. Most of it is intensive indoor production with only a few small outdoor sites where log cultivation is practiced.[[12]](#cite_note-Cornell_Small_Farms-2015-12)\n\n### Substrate requirements\n\nAs a [saprophyte](/wiki/Saprophyte) that occurs on dead wood,[[3]](#cite_note-drugs-3) *H.&#160;erinaceus* requires adequate [substrate](/wiki/Substrate_(biology)) factors, including suitable carbon and nitrogen sources, a certain pH value and ideal [carbon-to-nitrogen ratio](/wiki/Carbon-to-nitrogen_ratio).[[22]](#cite_note-22)[[23]](#cite_note-He-2017-23) \nMany different substrates have been used to successfully cultivate this mushroom. Depending on the type of cultivation, the substrate can be either solid (artificial log) or liquid (submerged culture and deep submerged culture). \nThe solid substrate is most commonly a mixture of [sawdust](/wiki/Sawdust) of [hardwood](/wiki/Hardwood) or [conifer](/wiki/Conifer) containing different complements that may include [wheat bran](/wiki/Wheat_bran), wheat [straw](/wiki/Straw), [soybean meal](/wiki/Soybean_meal), [corn meal](/wiki/Corn_meal), [rice bran](/wiki/Rice_bran), and rice straw. For example, *H.&#160;erinaceus* strains grow on beech sawdust substrate enriched with [wheat bran](/wiki/Wheat_bran) (20%), [rye](/wiki/Rye) grain (25%), [soybean meal](/wiki/Soybean_meal) (7%), [rapeseed](/wiki/Rapeseed) meal (10%), or meat-[osseous](/wiki/Osseous) flour (6%).[[21]](#cite_note-Hassan-2007-21) \nAn example of a liquid substrate composition can be [glucose](/wiki/Glucose) for the carbon source, soybean powder, corn powder, and wheat bran powder as a complex nitrogen source.[[23]](#cite_note-He-2017-23) The pH values most suitable for the favorable growth of *H. erinaceus* were in the range of 5.0–9.0, with pH 6.0 as optimal.[[24]](#cite_note-Nguyen-2018-24)\n\n### Climate requirements\n\n*Hericium erinaceus* requires a humid environment for its growth: 85 to 90% of relative humidity in the air.[[5]](#cite_note-Sokół-2016-5) The incubation temperature most suitable for the [mycelial](/wiki/Mycelium) growth of *H. erinaceus* was found to be 25&#160;°C,[[24]](#cite_note-Nguyen-2018-24) and the optimum temperature for vegetative growth was 26&#160;°C.[[24]](#cite_note-Nguyen-2018-24) *H.&#160;erinaceus* is unable to grow with a [water potential](/wiki/Water_potential) lower than -5 Mpa.[[16]](#cite_note-Boddy-2011-16)\n\nThe artificial cultivation of *H. erinaceus* was first reported in China in 1988. It is cultivated using artificial logs, bottles, and polypropylene bags. However, this type of artificial cultivation is not suitable for industrialized production due to its low yield and long cultivation cycles.[[23]](#cite_note-He-2017-23)\nSubmerged culture is a type of artificial cultivation of *H.&#160;erinaceus* whereby the fungus is grown in a liquid medium. Using this method, a large number of mycelia can be obtained quickly.[[23]](#cite_note-He-2017-23) Bioactive compounds can be sourced from the fruiting bodies, submerged-cultivated mycelial biomass, or liquid-cultivated broth. Growers optimize the culture medium composition to obtain simultaneously high yields of *H.&#160;erinaceus* mycelial biomass, [exopolysaccharides](/wiki/Exopolysaccharides), and [polysaccharides](/wiki/Polysaccharide).[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] Submerged [fermentation](/wiki/Fermentation) is preferable for the production of mycelial biomass and biologically active metabolites in order to produce a more uniform biomass and [extract](/wiki/Extract) products.[[25]](#cite_note-25)\nGrowth regulators, such as [2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid](/wiki/2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic_acid) and [gibberellin](/wiki/Gibberellin), were observed to have an advantageous effect on spore germination.[[26]](#cite_note-26) Other technologies, such as red and green laser light of low intensity, stimulated spore germination as well as the vegetative growth of mycelium.[[27]](#cite_note-27) [Argon](/wiki/Argon) and [helium](/wiki/Helium) [lasers](/wiki/Laser) also contributed to the acceleration of fruit body development by 36–51%.[[5]](#cite_note-Sokół-2016-5)[[28]](#cite_note-28)\n\nWild strains of *Hericium* spp. can be isolated and cultivated by first gathering fruiting bodies from fallen trees in the natural habitat. The fruiting bodies can then be opened to attain pieces of their inner spore-producing tissue. This tissue is then placed onto [Petri dishes](/wiki/Petri_dish) with [agar](/wiki/Agar_plate) to cultivate fungal colonies at 25&#160;°C. After several transfers to new Petri dishes to verify the purity of the strain, it can be kept at −80&#160;°C for long-term storage.[[29]](#cite_note-Grace-2015-29)\n\n[*](/wiki/File:Beholder_-_June_2022_-_Sarah_Stierch_05.jpg)[Rock cod](/wiki/Rock_cod) with grilled H.&#160;erinaceus*\nThe edible fruiting bodies are common in [gourmet](/wiki/Gourmet) cooking, with young specimens considered the best.[[30]](#cite_note-30) Alongside [shiitake](/wiki/Shiitake) (*Lentinus edodes*) and [oyster](/wiki/Pleurotus) (*Pleurotus ostreatus*) mushrooms, *H.&#160;erinaceus* is used as a specialty mushroom in recipes.[[29]](#cite_note-Grace-2015-29)[[31]](#cite_note-31)\n*H. erinaceus* fruiting bodies contain 57% [carbohydrates](/wiki/Carbohydrate) (8% as [dietary fiber](/wiki/Dietary_fiber)), 4% [fat](/wiki/Fat), and 22% [protein](/wiki/Protein_(nutrient)).[[32]](#cite_note-Mau-2001-32)\n\n### Traditional and contemporary uses\n\nUsed in [traditional Chinese medicine](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine) for centuries, *H.&#160;erinaceus* is commonly marketed as a dietary supplement,[[33]](#cite_note-livertox-33)[[3]](#cite_note-drugs-3) but lacks sufficient [scientific evidence](/wiki/Scientific_evidence) for safety or effectiveness, and quality can vary due to inconsistent processing and labeling.[[34]](#cite_note-opss-34)\nThough it is a generally safe edible mushroom, its efficacy and specific active compounds remain unconfirmed *[in vivo](/wiki/In_vivo)*.[[33]](#cite_note-livertox-33)\n\n- [Medicinal fungi](/wiki/Medicinal_fungi)\n\n- [Yamabushi](/wiki/Yamabushi)\n\n**[^](#cite_ref-Arora1986_1-0)** [Arora, David](/wiki/David_Arora) (1986) [1979].

          "abstract": "The culinary and medicinal mushroom Hericium erinaceus is widely consumed in Asian countries, but apparently not in the United States, for its nutritional and health benefits. To stimulate broader interest in the reported beneficial properties, this overview surveys and consolidates the widely scattered literature on the chemistry (isolation and structural characterization) of polysaccharides and secondary metabolites such as erinacines, hericerins, hericenones, resorcinols, steroids, mono- and diterpenes, and volatile aroma compounds, nutritional composition, food and industrial uses, and exceptional nutritional and health-promoting aspects of H. erinaceus. The reported health-promoting properties of the mushroom fruit bodies, mycelia, and bioactive pure compounds include antibiotic, anticarcinogenic, antidiabetic, antifatigue, antihypertensive, antihyperlipodemic, antisenescence, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, and neuroprotective properties and improvement of anxiety, cognitive function, and depression. The described anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and immunostimulating properties in cells, animals, and humans seem to be responsible for the multiple health-promoting properties. A wide range of research advances and techniques are described and evaluated. The collated information and suggestion for further research might facilitate and guide further studies to optimize the use of the whole mushrooms and about 70 characterized actual and potential bioactive secondary metabolites to help prevent or treat human chronic, cognitive, and neurological diseases.",

          "abstract": "Depression is a common and severe neuropsychiatric disorder that is one of the leading causes of global disease burden. Although various anti-depressants are currently available, their efficacies are barely adequate and many have side effects. Hericium erinaceus, also known as Lion's mane mushroom, has been shown to have various health benefits, including antioxidative, antidiabetic, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antihyperglycemic, and hypolipidemic effects. It has been used to treat cognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Bioactive compounds extracted from the mycelia and fruiting bodies of H. erinaceus have been found to promote the expression of neurotrophic factors that are associated with cell proliferation such as nerve growth factors. Although antidepressant effects of H. erinaceus have not been validated and compared to the conventional antidepressants, based on the neurotrophic and neurogenic pathophysiology of depression, H. erinaceus may be a potential alternative medicine for the treatment of depression. This article critically reviews the current literature on the potential benefits of H. erinaceus as a treatment for depressive disorder as well as its mechanisms underlying the antidepressant-like activities.",

Here, we introduce multicolor, resonance energy transfer-based NAD+ sensors covering nano- to millimolar concentration ranges for clinical NAD+ measurement and subcellular NAD+ visualization. The sensors captured the blood NAD+ increase induced by NMN supplementation and revealed the distinct subcellular effects of NAD+ precursors and modulators. The sensors then enabled high-throughput screenings for mitochondrial and nuclear NAD+ modulators and identified &#x3b1;-GPC, a cognition-related metabolite that induces NAD+ redistribution from mitochondria to the nucleus relative to the total adenine nucleotides, which was further confirmed by NAD+ FRET microscopy.",
