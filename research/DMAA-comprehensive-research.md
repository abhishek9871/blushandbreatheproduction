**Last Updated: November 28, 2025**

---

## SECTION 1: CORE SCIENTIFIC DATA

### 1.1 Chemical Information

**Full Chemical Name:** 1,3-Dimethylamylamine (DMAA)

**Alternative Names & Synonyms:**
- 4-Methylhexan-2-amine
- 1,3-Dimethylpentylamine
- Methylhexaneamine
- Geranamine
- Floradrene
- Forthane
- Forthan
- 2-Hexanamine, 4-methyl-
- 1,3-DMAA
- Dimethylamylamine
- 2-Amino-4-methylhexane

**Chemical Formula:** C₇H₁₇N

**Molecular Weight:** 115.22 g/mol

**CAS Number:** 105-41-9

**EINECS Number:** 203-296-1

**UNII:** X49C572YQO

**Origin & History:**
- **First Synthesized:** 1944 by Eli Lilly (Rohrmann and Shonle of Lilly Research Laboratories)
- **Pharmaceutical Use:** 1948-1983 as nasal decongestant under brand name Forthane (later Forthan)
- **Voluntary Withdrawal:** 1983 at manufacturer's request due to side effects
- **Re-emergence:** 2006 as dietary supplement ingredient for weight loss and exercise performance
- **Resurgence Period:** 2006-2013 in pre-workout and fat-burning supplements (Jack3d, OxyElite Pro)

**Natural vs. Synthetic Origin (The "Geranium Controversy"):**

DMAA has been marketed as a natural extract from rose geranium (Pelargonium/Geranium species), particularly claiming origin from Geranium oil. However, extensive laboratory research has definitively established that DMAA is **synthetic, not natural:**

- **NSF/USARIEM Study (2013):** Analyzed geranium and pelargonium species and their essential oils across multiple regions and found NO detectable DMAA in any natural plant samples. DMAA concentrations in supplements ranged from 0.11% to 67.3%, far exceeding any possible natural occurrence.

- **Multiple Independent Laboratory Analyses:** Research from University of Milan (Italy), University of Mississippi, University of Texas at Arlington, and ElSohly Laboratories all confirmed DMAA is synthetic. Laboratory analysis detected DMAA in 0.6-3.2 ppb range in most plant extracts tested—essentially trace amounts suggesting environmental contamination or intentional adulteration rather than natural production.

- **Chemical Detection in Plants:** Even when DMAA was detected in some Chinese-grown geranium samples at 254-350 ng/g, this was far below commercial supplement concentrations and inconsistent with natural plant synthesis pathways.

- **Regulatory Conclusion:** FDA, Health Canada, MHRA (UK), and TGA (Australia) all concluded that DMAA is a synthetic chemical, not a naturally-derived botanical ingredient.

### 1.2 Pharmacology

**Mechanism of Action:**

DMAA is a sympathomimetic amine that primarily functions as:

1. **Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor/Releasing Agent:** DMAA blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine at the norepinephrine transporter (NET) with modest affinity (Ki ~649 nM), causing accumulation of norepinephrine in synaptic spaces and leading to increased sympathetic nervous system activity.

2. **Dopamine Transporter (DAT) Interaction:** Recent 2023 research confirms DMAA is a **competitive inhibitor of DAT** with:
   - IC₅₀ of approximately **29.4 µM** (14.8 µM SD range)
   - Approximately **60-fold less potent than d-amphetamine** (amphetamine IC₅₀ ~0.66 µM)
   - Substrate-like binding to the S1 substrate binding site
   - Induces DAT endocytosis (internalization) via cocaine- and protein kinase A (PKA)-sensitive mechanisms
   - Binding affinity estimated at -4.3 kcal/mol (vs. amphetamine -5.5 kcal/mol and dopamine -5.8 kcal/mol)

3. **Vasoconstrictor Properties:** Direct smooth muscle constriction and blood vessel narrowing through sympathomimetic activity.

4. **Pressor Effects:** Elevation of blood pressure through vasoconstriction and sympathetic nervous system activation.

**Receptor Binding Profile:**

| Target | IC₅₀/Ki | Relative Potency | Notes |
|--------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| Norepinephrine Transporter (NET) | ~0.41 µM | ~71x more potent than DAT | Primary target |
| Dopamine Transporter (DAT) | ~29.4 µM | 60x less potent than amphetamine | Substrate-like |
| Serotonin Transporter (SERT) | >10,000 nM | Essentially inactive | Minimal interaction |
| Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1 (TAAR1) | No significant activity | — | Does NOT activate |

**Structural Comparison to Amphetamines:**

DMAA shares structural similarity with amphetamine (both are aliphatic amines with sympathomimetic properties) but differs significantly:

- **Structural Difference:** DMAA lacks the phenyl (aromatic) ring present in amphetamine. This aliphatic structure reduces potency at dopamine transporter but maintains sympathomimetic activity.
- **Potency Difference:** DMAA is approximately 45-60x **less potent** at the dopamine transporter than amphetamine.
- **Selectivity:** DMAA shows greater selectivity for the norepinephrine transporter (NET:DAT ratio favors NET), whereas amphetamine acts more broadly across multiple monoamine systems.
- **1950s Classification:** The original 1950 Dispensatory described DMAA as having systemic toxicity "greater than ephedrine and less than amphetamine."

**Pharmacokinetic Profile (Half-Life & Metabolism):**

- **Terminal Half-Life:** 8.45 ± 1.9 hours (range: 6.57-11.79 hours across individuals)
- **Peak Concentration (Cmax):** Approximately 70-77 ng/mL after 25 mg oral dose (achieved at 3-5 hours post-ingestion)
- **Oral Clearance:** 20.02 ± 5 L/hr⁻¹
- **Volume of Distribution:** 236 ± 38 L
- **Lag Time (Absorption Delay):** 0.14 ± 0.13 hours (approximately 8 minutes)
- **Time to Peak (Tmax):** 3-5 hours post-ingestion (range 2.0-6.0 hours)

**Metabolism & Excretion:**

- **Minimal Metabolism:** DMAA undergoes **minimal hepatic metabolism**—primarily excreted unchanged in urine (approximately 32 mg of a 40 mg dose recovered unchanged in urine).
- **Excretion Timeline:** Detectable in urine for extended periods; one study detected DMAA at 350 ng/mL after 4 days post-ingestion.
- **Prolonged Absorption:** Relatively slow absorption (4-12 hours compared to 1-2 hours for many drugs).
- **CYP2D6 Inhibition:** DMAA is a notable inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme, which metabolizes many medications, creating potential drug interaction risks.
- **Comparison to Caffeine:** DMAA has longer half-life (8.4 hours) than caffeine (5.4 hours) and shorter lag time (0.14 hours vs. 0.37 hours for caffeine).

**Plasma Concentration Data from Toxicity Cases:**

- **Recommended Dose (25 mg):** Plasma DMAA ~70 ng/mL
- **Case Reports (Toxicity):** 760-2,310 ng/mL (10-30x higher than therapeutic doses)
- **Extreme Case (Gee et al.):** Patient consuming 556 mg DMAA + caffeine + alcohol showed extreme toxicity

### 1.3 Detection Data

**Urine Detection Windows:**

- **Standard Urine Test:** DMAA is detectable in urine for approximately **4-7 days** after single use
- **Extended Detection:** One case reported detection at 350 ng/mL after 4 days (potentially up to 7+ days with sensitive testing)
- **Higher Doses:** Extended detection window with repeated use or high doses due to ~8.4 hour half-life

**Blood Detection Window:**

- **Peak Detection:** Maximum concentration 3-5 hours post-ingestion
- **Detection Duration:** Approximately **24-48 hours** in blood for single doses
- **Half-Life Based Calculation:** Given 8.45-hour half-life, detectable for ~40+ hours (approximately 5 half-lives)

**Hair Detection Window:**

- **Hair Follicle Tests:** Similar to other stimulants, **up to 90 days** of detection window
- **Standard Sample:** 1.5-inch hair sample represents ~90 days of drug history
- **Hair Type Consideration:** Darker hair contains more melanin, which binds drug metabolites more readily, potentially showing higher concentrations

**False Positive for Amphetamines:**

**YES - DMAA Causes Immunoassay False Positives for Amphetamines:**

- **Military Study Finding:** Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) analysis of false-positive amphetamine samples revealed:
  - **92.3% of false-positive samples** contained DMAA at ~6.0 mg/L concentration
  - 124 out of 134 false-positive amphetamine samples in Department of Defense testing were caused by DMAA

- **Mechanism:** Immunoassay screening tests (EMIT, enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique) lack specificity for individual drugs—they detect structurally related compounds. DMAA's sympathomimetic structure shares enough similarity to trigger positive results.

- **Immunoassay Kits Affected:** Both LabCorp and other major immunoassay kits tested positive for amphetamines when DMAA was present.

- **Confirmatory Testing:** Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) can differentiate DMAA from amphetamine and correctly identify false positives.

- **Military Note:** Air Force Drug Testing Laboratory states that under GC-MS confirmatory testing, DMAA will **NEVER produce a positive result for amphetamines or other DoD-tested drugs**, effectively ruling out the false positive issue with proper testing protocols.

**Drug Test Types & Detection:**

| Test Type | Detects DMAA? | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Immunoassay (EMIT/Rapid Screen) | YES (False Positive for Amphetamines) | May flag as amphetamine |
| GC-MS (Confirmatory) | YES - Distinguishes from Amphetamines | Confirms DMAA specifically; negative for amp |
| LC-MS/MS | YES | High selectivity; specifically identifies DMAA |
| Hair Test | YES | 90-day detection window |
| Urine Chromatography | YES | Standard 4-7 day window |
| Saliva Test | Limited data | Likely 1-3 days maximum |

- **District Court Ruling (2017):** Ruled against Hi-Tech, determining:
  - "DMAA is not an 'herb or other botanical'"
  - "It is not a 'constituent' of an herb or other botanical"
  - "It is not generally recognized by qualified experts as safe under conditions of intended use"

- **11th Circuit Appeals Court (August 2019):** Affirmed district court 2-to-1 decision, upholding FDA's authority and DMAA's illegal status.

- **En Banc Review Request (October 2019):** Hi-Tech requested full panel rehearing—**DENIED (April 8, 2020)**.

- **Supreme Court Petition (September 2020):** Hi-Tech requested U.S. Supreme Court review—**DENIED (October 2020)**, effectively ending legal challenges.

**USPlabs Court Cases:**

- Criminal charges filed against USPlabs executives (Jacobo Geissler, Jonathan Doyle) and SK Laboratory (Sitesh Patel) for conspiracy to defraud consumers regarding DMAA sourcing claims.
- Evidence showed executives knew DMAA was 100% synthetic but claimed it was natural to facilitate retail sales.

## SECTION 5: PRACTICAL USER INFORMATION

### 5.1 Detection & Drug Testing

**Pre-Test Strategy (If DMAA Recently Used):**

- **Urine Test Timing:** DMAA detectable for 4-7 days; wait at least 7-10 days for maximum clearance
- **Blood Test Timing:** Detectable 24-48 hours; wait 48+ hours for blood testing
- **Hair Test Timing:** Detectable up to 90 days; hair cannot be cleared (grows ~0.5 inches/month)
- **Critical Warning:** Hair testing will show positive for up to 3 months regardless of waiting period

**Which Tests Detect DMAA:**

| Test Type | Detects DMAA | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Immunoassay (EMIT)** | YES - FALSE POSITIVE FOR AMP | Will flag as amphetamine; requires GC-MS confirmation |
| **GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry)** | YES - CONFIRMS DMAA | Specifically identifies as DMAA, NOT amphetamine; DoD standard |
| **LC-MS/MS** | YES | Highly specific; clearly identifies DMAA |
| **5-Panel Urine Test** | Likely YES (as amp) | Immunoassay; will show as amphetamine positive |
| **10-Panel Urine Test** | Likely YES (as amp) | Depends on specific test components |
| **12-Panel Urine Test** | Likely YES (as amp) | Same issue as above |
| **Hair Follicle Test** | YES | 90-day detection window; specifically identifies DMAA |
| **Saliva Test** | Possible | Limited data; likely 1-3 day window if detectable |
| **EtG Alcohol Test** | NO | Different substance; doesn't detect DMAA |

**False Positive Resolution:**

- **How to Clear a False Positive:** Request **confirmatory GC-MS testing**
- **Why It Works:** GC-MS uses mass spectrometry to determine exact molecular structure; it clearly differentiates DMAA from amphetamine (different fragmentation patterns)
- **Military Note:** Air Force explicitly states DMAA will be identified as DMAA under GC-MS, not as amphetamine or other drug
- **Important:** Simple urine test will remain positive; only GC-MS can legally clear you of amphetamine charges

**Military-Specific Testing:**

- **DoD Standard:** DoD uses GC-MS confirmatory testing
- **Air Force Testing Laboratory:** Clearly states DMAA will never produce false positive for amphetamines under their standard testing protocol
- **Service Member Protection:** If tested positive for amphetamines after DMAA use, request GC-MS confirmation—will definitively prove DMAA, not amphetamine
- **Drug Demand Reduction:** All service branches aware of DMAA false positive issue

## SECTION 6: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)

**Q: Is DMAA legal in the United States in 2025?**

A: **No, DMAA is illegal in the U.S.** It is prohibited for use in dietary supplements by the FDA since 2013. The compound is classified as an illegal "new dietary ingredient" lacking required safety documentation. The compound cannot be legally marketed as a dietary supplement. While underground suppliers continue selling DMAA products online, they violate FDA regulations. Any product marketed as a dietary supplement containing DMAA is considered adulterated.

---

**Q: Will DMAA show up on a drug test?**

A: **Possibly, but with important caveats:**

- **Immunoassay (initial urine screen):** YES - Will show as positive for AMPHETAMINES (false positive for other drugs, not a true positive for amphetamine)
- **GC-MS confirmatory test:** YES - Specifically identifies as DMAA, NOT amphetamine
- **Drug screening result:** Under standard confirmatory testing (GC-MS), DMAA-positive results will clearly distinguish from actual amphetamines
- **Important for Military/Employers:** Use GC-MS confirmation to resolve false positive; document that positive was DMAA, not illicit amphetamine

---

**Q: How long does DMAA stay in your system?**

A: 

- **Blood:** Approximately 24-48 hours (detected for ~5 half-lives given 8.45-hour half-life)
- **Urine:** 4-7 days for standard detection; potentially longer with sensitive testing
- **Hair:** Up to 90 days (1.5-inch sample represents 90-day history)
- **Plasma Half-Life:** 8.45 ± 1.9 hours (approximately 8-9 hours average)
- **Peak Concentration:** Reached 3-5 hours post-ingestion; remains detectable throughout elimination phase

---

**Q: Why was DMAA banned?**

A: **Safety concerns including documented health risks:**

1. **Documented Adverse Events:** FDA received 86+ reports of serious health problems including heart attacks, strokes, cerebral hemorrhage, liver failure, seizures, deaths
2. **Documented Deaths:** At least 5 confirmed deaths directly linked to DMAA, including London marathoner Claire Squires (2012) and military service members
3. **Regulatory Findings:** FDA determined DMAA is synthetic, not natural (despite marketing claims); lacks required safety data for dietary ingredient classification
4. **International Action:** Canada banned DMAA (2011); UK banned (2012); WADA banned (2010); multiple countries took similar action
5. **Military Casualties:** Deaths of Fort Bliss soldiers during physical training using DMAA-containing supplements prompted military ban
6. **Scientific Data:** Insufficient safety evidence; case reports documented severe cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events in young, previously healthy individuals

---

**Q: Is DMAA the same as amphetamine?**

A: **No, but they're chemically related:**

- **Structural Difference:** Both are amines, but DMAA lacks the aromatic (phenyl) ring present in amphetamine. This makes DMAA an aliphatic amine vs. phenethylamine.
- **Potency Difference:** DMAA is approximately **60x LESS potent** at dopamine transporter than amphetamine
- **Classification:** Amphetamine is Schedule II controlled substance; DMAA is (or was) dietary supplement ingredient (though now banned)
- **Mechanism Similarity:** Both interact with monoamine transporters (dopamine, norepinephrine) to produce stimulant effects
- **False Positive Connection:** Immunoassay drug tests cannot distinguish between DMAA and amphetamine due to structural similarity; GC-MS can differentiate

---

**Q: Can DMAA cause a heart attack?**

A: **Yes, heart attack risk is documented and real:**

- **Mechanism:** DMAA causes severe vasoconstriction, increases heart rate, elevates blood pressure, and increases myocardial oxygen demand—all risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI)
- **Case Documentation:** Multiple case reports of MI associated with DMAA; Fort Bliss military personnel died of cardiac events while using DMAA-containing supplements
- **Risk Factors Increase:** Combined use with caffeine, physical exertion, alcohol, underlying cardiovascular disease significantly elevate risk
- **Young Victims:** Cases documented in previously healthy 21-41 year-old individuals, suggesting DMAA poses particular risk for sudden cardiac events
- **Claire Squires Case:** Though technically acute heart failure rather than MI, cardiac event occurred during marathon with DMAA use; coroner linked DMAA as contributing factor
- **Dose-Dependent:** Higher doses dramatically increase risk; even lower doses pose risk to susceptible individuals

---

**Q: Is DMAA natural or synthetic?**

A: **DMAA is 100% synthetic, NOT natural:**

- **Laboratory Confirmation:** Multiple independent studies (NSF, USARIEM, University of Milan, University of Mississippi, University of Texas at Arlington, ElSohly Laboratories) analyzed geranium plants and found NO DMAA in natural plant sources
- **Marketing Deception:** Manufacturers claimed DMAA was natural extract from rose geranium (Pelargonium/Geranium species); investigations proved false
- **Regulatory Finding:** FDA, Health Canada, MHRA, TGA all concluded DMAA is synthetic
- **Criminal Charges:** USPlabs executives faced charges for conspiracy to defraud consumers by claiming synthetic DMAA was natural
- **Supplement Concentrations:** Commercial supplements contained 0.11-67.3% DMAA vs. trace amounts in plants—clear evidence of synthetic addition, not natural extraction
- **Scientific Consensus:** DMAA is a pharmaceutical chemical synthesized via multi-step organic synthesis; not a botanical constituent

---

**Q: What products contain DMAA?**

A: **Historical Products (Pre-2013, mostly discontinued):**

- **Jack3d** (USPlabs) - Most popular; contained 6-10 mg per scoop
- **OxyElite Pro** (USPlabs) - Original formula; also reformulated with aegeline after DMAA ban
- **Hydroxystrim**, **SuperCharge**, **MusclePharm Assault**, **Gaspari Super Pump 250**, **iSatori Hypertest**, various others
- **Over 250 commercial supplements** contained DMAA before FDA action

- Various **generic DMAA powders** from international suppliers
- **Unlisted DMAA products** from online sellers
- Limited **Polish/Eastern European** manufactured DMAA products
- Products still available through gray-market online retailers

**How to Avoid:** Check labels for DMAA/methylhexaneamine/geranamine; use NSF Certified for Sport® products; verify through third-party testing

---

**Q: Is DMAA banned in sports?**

A: **Yes, DMAA is universally banned in sports:**

- **WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency):** Banned since 2010 (effective January 1, 2010); listed as prohibited stimulant at all times
- **NCAA:** Banned for all student-athletes
- **Professional Sports:** NFL, NBA, MLB, PGA, LPGA, NHL all prohibit DMAA
- **Olympic Sports:** WADA ban covers Olympic athletes
- **Military Sports:** DoD bans DMAA for military personnel
- **Consequences:** Athletes testing positive face suspension/bans; multiple professional athletes suspended (see Section 2.3 for examples)

---

**Q: What are safer alternatives to DMAA?**

A: **Legal, Evidence-Based Alternatives:**

1. **Caffeine (100-300 mg):** Well-researched, proven ergogenic effect, generally safe
2. **Citrulline Malate (6-8 g):** Improves muscle pump and endurance without stimulant side effects
3. **Beta-Alanine (3-5 g):** Improves muscular endurance; mild side effect (tingling)
4. **Creatine Monohydrate (3-5 g daily):** Decades of safety research; consistent strength/power benefits
5. **L-Theanine + Caffeine:** Synergistic combination for focus without jitteriness
6. **Beetroot Juice (500 mL):** Natural ergogenic; improves blood flow and oxygen utilization

## CONCLUSION

DMAA remains a significant public health concern despite its legal prohibition as a dietary supplement ingredient in the United States and many other countries. The compound is a synthetic sympathomimetic amine that has been documented as causing serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, hepatic, and psychiatric adverse events. Multiple deaths have been attributed to DMAA use, particularly when combined with exercise, caffeine, or alcohol.

While DMAA is effective as a stimulant, safer alternatives exist that have comparable or superior efficacy with dramatically lower adverse event profiles. Consumers should prioritize legal, well-studied supplements with established safety records. Healthcare providers should maintain awareness of DMAA-related adverse events and screen patients appropriately when encountering unexplained cardiovascular or neurological emergencies in previously healthy young people.

The false-positive drug test issue related to DMAA remains relevant, particularly for military personnel and individuals subject to drug screening. Confirmatory GC-MS testing definitively resolves DMAA-positive immunoassay results.
