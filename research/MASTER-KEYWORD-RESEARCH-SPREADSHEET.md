## 🏆 TIER 1: HIGHEST PRIORITY KEYWORDS (IMMEDIATE WINS)
*These keywords have the lowest competition and can rank within days/weeks*

| # | Keyword | Search Intent | Current #1 | Competition | Opportunity Score | Est. Monthly Traffic |
|---|---------|---------------|------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Dark Labs Crack Gold 2025 Batch Review vs Fake** | Commercial/Panic | Reddit thread | 🟢 VERY LOW | 95% | 500-800 |
| 2 | **List of Banned Pre Workouts 2025 FDA** | Informational | elchemy.com (random blog) | 🟢 VERY LOW | 90% | 1,200-2,000 |
| 3 | **Skull Labs Angel Dust Ingredients Explained** | Informational | Product pages (no explainer) | 🟢 VERY LOW | 90% | 400-600 |
| 4 | **dmaa drug test** | Practical/Concern | progressivediagnostics.com.au | 🟢 LOW | 90% | 800-1,200 |
| 5 | **how long does dmaa stay in your system** | Practical/Planning | unitedability.org | 🟢 LOW | 90% | 600-900 |
| 6 | **dmaa euphoria** | Experience/Effects | Reddit threads | 🟢 LOW | 85% | 300-500 |

### 🔥 WHY THESE ARE IMMEDIATE WINS:
- **Dark Labs Crack Gold**: Reddit dominates - NO structured blog guide exists
- **Banned Pre Workouts List**: Google says no clean brand-name list exists (only ingredient lists)
- **Skull Labs Explained**: Google literally flagging "Missing: Explained" 
- **DMAA Drug Test**: Small Australian testing lab at #1 - massive authority opportunity
- **DMAA System Duration**: Low-authority aggregator at #1 - easy to outrank
- **DMAA Euphoria**: Forum-dominated SERP - structured content will dominate

---

## 🥈 TIER 2: HIGH PRIORITY KEYWORDS (1-3 Month Timeline)
*Moderate competition but clear content gaps identified*

| # | Keyword | Search Intent | Current Competition | Opportunity Score | Est. Monthly Traffic |
|---|---------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 7 | **Does DMHA Cause False Positive Drug Test 2025** | Panic/Concern | bestpricenutrition.com, OPSS (conflicting info!) | 🟡 MEDIUM | 80% | 400-600 |
| 8 | **dmaa vs dmha** | Comparison | darklabs.pro, WebMD | 🟡 MEDIUM | 80% | 700-1,000 |
| 9 | **dmaa dosage bodybuilding** | Practical Usage | mrsupplement.com.au, Reddit | 🟡 MEDIUM | 75% | 500-800 |
| 10 | **DMAA vs DMHA vs DMBA pre-workout comparison experience** | Deep Comparison | No comprehensive guide | 🟡 MEDIUM | 80% | 300-500 |
| 11 | **how to spot fake vs real DMAA in supplements 2025** | Verification/Safety | No dedicated guide | 🟡 MEDIUM | 75% | 200-400 |

### 💡 WHY THESE RANK TIER 2:
- **DMHA Drug Test**: Conflicting information = opportunity for definitive guide
- **DMAA vs DMHA**: Small blogs ranking but WebMD also present
- **Dosage Bodybuilding**: Multiple Reddit threads = user interest but forum competition
- **Triple Comparison**: No one has done comprehensive DMAA/DMHA/DMBA comparison
- **Spot Fake DMAA**: User safety query with no dedicated content

---

## 🥉 TIER 3: SECONDARY PRIORITY KEYWORDS (3-6 Month Timeline)
*Good opportunities but require stronger content/authority*

| # | Keyword | Search Intent | Competition Level | Opportunity Score | Est. Monthly Traffic |
|---|---------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 12 | **DMAA alternatives** | Commercial/Solutions | MrSupplement, NIH - MEDIUM | 70% | 600-900 |
| 13 | **DMAA withdrawal symptoms** | Medical/Concern | Low content volume | 70% | 200-400 |
| 14 | **natural alternatives to dmaa** | Commercial/Solutions | Generic content | 70% | 300-500 |
| 15 | **DMAA military drug test** | Niche/Practical | OPSS has content | 65% | 400-600 |

---

## ❌ RED OCEAN KEYWORDS TO AVOID
