Now I have comprehensive research. Let me create a detailed report with all the findings organized by category.

## Comprehensive List of Banned Pre-Workout Supplements (2025)

### Overview

The pre-workout supplement industry has faced significant regulatory scrutiny over the past decade, with over 50 products banned or recalled due to dangerous ingredients.

**Criminal Prosecution:** USPlabs (Jack3d, OxyElite Pro) was criminally indicted in 2015 with executives charged with conspiracy, wire fraud, and food mislabeling. The company destroyed $8 million worth of products.[7][2]

***

### **2. DMBA-Containing Products - FDA Ban: April 2015**[8][9][10]

DMBA (1,3-dimethylbutylamine) was determined by the FDA in 2015 to be unsafe and unapproved as a dietary ingredient. The FDA issued warning letters to 25 companies.[11][8]

| Product Name | Manufacturer | Ban Date | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Muscle Sports Rhino** | Muscle Sports | 2015 | Discontinued |

DMBA is chemically similar to banned DMAA and lacks human safety testing. It appears on the **DoD Prohibited Dietary Supplement Ingredients list** and may trigger false positives on amphetamine screens (though confirmation testing distinguishes it).[8]

***

### **3. DMHA-Containing Products - FDA Ban: April 2019**[12][13][14]

DMHA (2-aminoisoheptane, 1,5-dimethylhexylamine) was classified by the FDA as unsafe and adulterated. The FDA issued warning letters to companies including **Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals, IQ Formulations, Metabolic Nutrition, Iron Brothers Supplements, and Forbidden Labz** in April 2019, with additional actions in September and October 2019.[14]

| Product Name | Manufacturer | Ban Date | Status | WADA/DoD Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Chaos and Pain Cannibal Ferox AMPED** | Chaos and Pain | 2019 | Discontinued | WADA Prohibited |
| **Dark Energy** | Unknown Distributor | 2021 | Illegally available (marketed "research chemical") | Contains DMAA + DMHA |
| **1MR OG (2024-2025 reformulation)** | BPI Sports | 2024 | Currently available | Contains DMHA - WARNING: This is the reformulated version after DMAA ban |

**2024-2025 Note:** BPI Sports brought back 1MR with DMHA as the stimulant, making it still technically in violation of FDA regulations. DMHA appears on the **DoD Prohibited Dietary Supplement Ingredients list** and carries the same cardiovascular risks as DMAA.[15][8]

***
