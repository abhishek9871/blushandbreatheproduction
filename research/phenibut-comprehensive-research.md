Phenibut (β-Phenyl-γ-aminobutyric acid) is a synthetic GABA analogue developed in the Soviet Union that acts primarily as a GABA-B receptor agonist and α2δ voltage‑gated calcium channel ligand, with significant risks of dependence and a poorly defined but potentially severe withdrawal syndrome. It remains a prescription anxiolytic/nootropic in parts of Eastern Europe while being unapproved, unscheduled but supplement‑restricted in the United States and scheduled or otherwise controlled in several other countries.[1][2][3][4][5]

## Core scientific data

- Chemical names and synonyms:
  - International nonproprietary name: phenibut; systematic: 4‑amino‑3‑phenylbutanoic acid (β‑phenyl‑γ‑aminobutyric acid).[6]
  - Common synonyms: Fenibut, β‑Phenyl‑GABA, β‑Phenyl‑γ‑aminobutyric acid, phenigamma; main trade names include Noofen, Fenibut, Citrocard and others in former Soviet countries.[5][7]
- Key identifiers:
  - Chemical formula: C10H13NO2; molecular weight ≈ 179.22 g/mol.[6]
  - CAS number: 1078‑21‑3 (for β‑phenyl‑γ‑aminobutyric acid).[4]
- Origin and pharmaceutical status:
  - Developed in the Soviet Union (Leningrad) in the 1960s as a neuropsychotropic agent with anxiolytic and nootropic properties, used to treat tension, anxiety, fear and sleep disturbance in psychosomatic or neurotic patients.[7][5]
  - Still used as a prescription medicine under names such as Noofen and Citrocard in Russia and several post‑Soviet or Eastern European jurisdictions for anxiety‑neurotic states, insomnia and related conditions.[8][9][5]

### Pharmacology

- Mechanism of action:
  - Phenibut is a GABA analogue that crosses the blood–brain barrier more readily than GABA because of the phenyl ring on the beta carbon.[10][6]
  - It is a GABA agonist acting primarily at GABA-B receptors; the R‑isomer has measurable GABA-B activity but lower affinity than baclofen.[1][10]
  - R‑phenibut also binds the α2δ subunit of voltage‑dependent calcium channels, with about five‑fold higher affinity for α2δ than for GABA-B, producing gabapentin‑like antinociceptive effects.[11][12]
- Receptor profile and comparison:
  - Classic descriptions emphasize GABA-B agonism with little to no direct GABA-A receptor activity, unlike benzodiazepines.[5]
  - Compared with related drugs:
    - Baclofen: stronger, selective GABA-B agonist with higher GABA-B affinity; phenibut has weaker GABA-B affinity but adds α2δ binding.[11][1]
    - Gabapentin/pregabalin: primarily α2δ ligands without GABA-B agonism; phenibut partially overlaps their α2δ binding mechanism.[12][10]
    - GHB: GABA-B agonist and GHB‑receptor ligand with rapid onset and short duration; phenibut has slower onset and longer duration but both share risk of sedative‑hypnotic dependence.[10]
- Pharmacokinetics:
  - Absorption/bioavailability: human data are limited, but oral phenibut is described as “well‑absorbed” with wide distribution.[6][10]
  - Blood–brain barrier: only a small fraction of the dose (about 0.1%) reaches the brain, yet this is much higher than GABA and sufficient for psychotropic effects.[6]
  - Half‑life: in healthy volunteers given a single 250 mg oral dose, plasma elimination half‑life ≈ 5.3 hours.[3][10]
  - Excretion and metabolism: around 63–65% of a 250 mg dose is excreted unchanged in urine, with clearance similar to creatinine; limited evidence suggests minimal metabolism and primary renal elimination.[13][3][10]
- Clinical duration:
  - Despite a ~5.3 h half‑life, clinical effects are often described as lasting 15–24 hours after oral dosing, indicating a dissociation between plasma clearance and subjective duration.[13]

### Dosage information

- Therapeutic dosing (former USSR / Eastern Europe):
  - Historical and current monographs (e.g., Noofen) describe typical adult oral doses of 250–500 mg two or three times daily, with maximum daily doses around 750–1500 mg depending on indication and treatment duration.[9][8][5]
  - Recent trial data in Latvia used Noofen 250 mg capsules in divided doses for adjustment disorder with anxious/depressive symptoms.[8]
- Common off‑label / recreational patterns:
  - Surveys, toxicology and case reports consistently describe self‑administered doses from 1–3 g/day for “anxiolytic/nootropic” use and up to 5–30+ g/day in dependent or heavily tolerant users.[14][3][7]
- Dose–response and tolerance:
  - Anxiolytic and sedative effects increase with dose but plateau and become dysphoric or paradoxically stimulating in some users at high doses, particularly during chronic use.[3][7]
  - Case series and reviews describe substantial tolerance developing over days to weeks of continuous daily use, often leading to rapid dose escalation into multi‑gram ranges.[14][3]
  - The 2024 systematic review of withdrawal cases reported mean daily doses in dependent individuals often above 5–10 g, with durations ranging from weeks to several years.[14]

## Regulatory and legal status

### United States

- Federal status:
  - Phenibut is not approved by the FDA as a drug or dietary supplement ingredient and has no recognized medical use in the U.S.[15][16][17]
  - It is not scheduled under the federal Controlled Substances Act as of 2025, so possession is not generally a federal crime.[2][18]
- FDA actions:
  - On April 10–16, 2019, FDA issued warning letters to companies marketing products labeled as dietary supplements containing phenibut, stating that phenibut does not meet the statutory definition of a dietary ingredient and that such products are misbranded/adulterated.[16][19][17]
- FTC / marketing:
  - Public legal analyses note FDA’s position renders phenibut‑containing products marketed as dietary supplements unlawful, effectively restricting compliant mainstream supplement sales; FTC may act against deceptive marketing, but specific FTC‑only phenibut actions are less documented than FDA letters.[19]
- State action:
  - Multiple sources describe phenibut as “legal but unregulated” at federal level, while some states have considered or enacted controls.[18][20][2]
  - Open‑access regulatory summaries consistently list Alabama and Kentucky as states that have moved to restrict or schedule phenibut, but detailed, up‑to‑date 2024–2025 state‑by‑state statutes are not comprehensively summarized in single sources; this is a key area where data remain fragmented and may conflict between advocacy and legal sites.[20]
- 2024–2025 developments:
  - Recent 2024–2025 policy discussions about “research chemical” nootropics and online sales include phenibut in broader reviews, but no federal scheduling change had been implemented by late 2025.[20]

### International status

- Russia and former Soviet region:
  - Phenibut remains a prescription neuropsychotropic drug used for anxiety–neurotic states, sleep disturbances and related indications; it is marketed under trade names including Noofen and Citrocard.[9][8][5]
- European Union:
  - Noofen (phenibut) 250 mg capsules are registered as a prescription medicine in Latvia and “several other countries inside and outside the European Union”, indicating country‑specific prescription‑only status rather than EU‑wide authorization.[8]
- United Kingdom:
  - UK regulatory discussions and MHRA enforcement actions have targeted phenibut as an unlicensed “smart drug” / cognitive enhancer; products containing phenibut require a marketing authorization and cannot legally be sold as food supplements.[21][4]
- Australia:
  - The Australian Advisory Committee on Medicines Scheduling (ACCS/ACMS) recommended classifying phenibut as a Schedule 9 prohibited substance, with implementation from 1 February 2018; it therefore cannot be legally supplied other than for specific research purposes.[22][4]
- Canada and others:
  - A New Zealand regulatory briefing citing Health Canada indicates phenibut is “unscheduled” in Canada but not acceptable as a natural health product ingredient, limiting legal marketing while not making simple possession a criminal offense.[4]
  - WHO and other international reviews note growing concerns and recommend national control measures but do not list a global scheduling under UN conventions as of the latest reports.[10]

### Supplement/retail status (2025)

- Historical use in supplements:
  - Phenibut has been widely sold online as a “nootropic”, “sleep aid” or “anxiety supplement”, often as bulk powder or in capsules, sometimes blended with other sedatives.[7][20]
- Consequences of FDA action:
  - Following the 2019 FDA warning letters, mainstream U.S. supplement brands and large retailers (including major online marketplaces) have removed overt phenibut‑labeled dietary supplements from compliant supplement listings, although phenibut remains available from specialty “research chemical” vendors.[16][19][20]
- 2025 availability:
  - Addiction‑treatment and harm‑reduction resources in 2024–2025 describe phenibut as still legal to buy and possess in the U.S., typically sold online as a “research chemical” rather than as a dietary supplement.[23][2][18]

## Dependence and withdrawal

### Dependence profile

- Development of dependence:
  - Case reports and reviews document development of dependence after as little as 2–3 weeks of daily use in some individuals, especially at doses ≥1 g/day, with much higher risk after months of escalating use.[3][14]
  - The 2018 NIH‑hosted case report and the 2024 systematic review both highlight phenibut’s substantial dependence liability, particularly in people with histories of alcohol or drug misuse.[14][3]
- Tolerance:
  - Tolerance to anxiolytic and sedative effects often develops over days to weeks, prompting dose escalation from typical starting doses (e.g., 0.5–1 g/day) to multi‑gram regimens.[3][14]
- Physical vs psychological dependence:
  - Withdrawal cases show clear physical dependence (autonomic instability, tremor, insomnia, psychomotor agitation) together with strong psychological craving, anxiety and dysphoria.[15][14]
- Risk factors:
  - The systematic review of 15+ cases found most patients had histories of substance use disorders or anxiety/depression, consumed high daily doses (often >5–10 g), and used phenibut for weeks to years before presentation.[15][14]

### Withdrawal syndrome

- Acute withdrawal symptoms:
  - Commonly reported symptoms include:
    - Severe anxiety, panic, agitation and psychomotor restlessness.[14][3]
    - Insomnia, reduced need for sleep, and circadian disruption.[14]
    - Hallucinations (visual and auditory), psychosis, depersonalization and confusion.[1][14]
    - Autonomic signs: tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, mydriasis, temperature dysregulation, tremor and myoclonus or other abnormal movements.[14]
    - Somatic symptoms: muscle aches, headaches, gastrointestinal upset, decreased appetite and fatigue.[3][14]
- Timeline and duration:
  - Many cases report onset within 24–72 hours after abrupt cessation or major dose reduction, with peak symptoms over the next several days.[3][14]
  - The 2024 systematic review notes that most acute withdrawals described in case reports resolved with medical treatment over 5–14 days, but some required longer tapers or inpatient stays.[14]
  - At least one early case (Magsalin 2010) described clinically significant withdrawal emerging after only two weeks of continuous use of 1 g/day.[14]
- Protracted symptoms:
  - Long‑term complaints after acute stabilization can include persistent anxiety, insomnia, mood instability and cognitive “fog”; these are described narratively in case follow‑ups but not systematically quantified.[3][14]
- Comparison to alcohol/benzodiazepine withdrawal:
  - Clinical presentations can resemble severe sedative‑hypnotic withdrawal with delirium, psychosis and autonomic instability, drawing parallels to complicated benzodiazepine or alcohol withdrawal.[15][3]
  - However, the evidence base is limited to case reports; there are no large prospective cohorts to precisely compare frequency of seizures, delirium tremens‑like states or mortality.[10][14]

### Documented cases and outcomes

- Case reports and systematic review:
  - The 2024 systematic review identified 15 detailed phenibut withdrawal cases in the literature from 2010–2023, most presenting to emergency departments.[15][14]
  - Doses in these cases ranged roughly from 1 g/day up to more than 30 g/day, with time on phenibut spanning from 2 weeks to several years.[14]
  - Common presenting problems included psychomotor agitation, self‑harm, hallucinations, insomnia and tachycardia.[14]
- Hospitalizations and severe outcomes:
  - Many patients required inpatient hospitalization; some were admitted to intensive or high‑dependency units because of severe agitation, psychosis or respiratory issues.[3][14]
  - Individual case reports describe serious events such as jumping from a height during psychosis, hypertensive crises, and in one case respiratory failure requiring advanced care.[14]
  - Published literature focuses largely on survival and withdrawal management; documented deaths directly attributed solely to phenibut withdrawal (i.e., excluding mixed overdoses or trauma) are rare or absent in the peer‑reviewed cases synthesized in the 2024 review.[10][14]

### Medical management

- Tapering and substitution:
  - Because phenibut products are unregulated and pure pharmaceutical phenibut is not clinically available in many countries, most published cases have used cross‑taper strategies with GABAergic agents rather than direct phenibut taper.[3][14]
  - Common strategies in case reports:
    - Baclofen tapers (leveraging stronger, prescribed GABA-B agonism) over days to several weeks.[24][14]
    - Benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, lorazepam) to control agitation, insomnia and autonomic symptoms, often combined with baclofen or phenobarbital.[3][14]
    - Phenobarbital or other barbiturates in intensive settings for severe withdrawal and polysubstance cases.[14]
  - One early case (Magsalin 2010) used a supervised phenibut taper to manage withdrawal after two weeks of use.[14]
- When hospitalization is indicated:
  - Features such as hallucinations, psychosis, suicidal or violent behavior, severe insomnia, tachycardia/hypertension, or inability to care for oneself are recurrent reasons for ED presentation and hospital admission.[15][14]
  - The literature repeatedly stresses the absence of standardized guidelines and recommends conservative management with close monitoring similar to other sedative‑hypnotic withdrawals, particularly when doses are high or other substances are involved.[15][3]

## Health risks and adverse events

### Short‑term risks

- Overdose and acute toxicity:
  - Acute ingestion of large doses can cause profound sedation, confusion, psychosis, agitation, vomiting, impaired coordination, and in some cases seizures or respiratory compromise.[1][3][14]
  - Animal studies report relatively high LD50 values (700–900 mg/kg intraperitoneal in rodents), but human toxicity occurs at far lower doses, especially with co‑ingestants.[7]
- CNS and respiratory depression:
  - Case reports of overdose or withdrawal often show fluctuating CNS states (somnolence alternating with agitation), and at least one case describes respiratory failure in the setting of heavy phenibut use and withdrawal.[14]
  - Sedation is potentiated by other CNS depressants, increasing risk of respiratory depression, loss of consciousness and aspiration.[10][3]
- Hangover and rebound:
  - Users frequently describe next‑day “hangover” effects—fatigue, cognitive slowing, mood changes and irritability—after single or intermittent high doses; case descriptions and clinical commentaries echo these patterns.[7][3]

### Long‑term risks

- Cognitive and psychiatric effects:
  - Long‑term high‑dose use has been associated with cognitive impairment, memory problems, mood instability and psychotic episodes, although causality is complicated by co‑use of other substances and psychiatric comorbidities.[3][14]
- Dependence:
  - Dependence and severe withdrawal constitute the major well‑documented long‑term risk; multiple countries have cited this in their regulatory restrictions.[4][10]
- Organ toxicity:
  - Available human data suggest phenibut is largely excreted unchanged renally, with no consistent pattern of direct organ toxicity (e.g., liver failure) in case reports when other factors are controlled.[10][3]
  - Regulatory reviews still emphasize uncertainty and the possibility of harm, particularly with high doses or contaminated products.[4][10]

### Drug interactions

- Alcohol:
  - Co‑use with alcohol is very common in case reports and significantly increases risks of CNS and respiratory depression, disinhibition, blackouts and complex withdrawal syndromes.[3][14]
- Benzodiazepines and other sedatives:
  - Concurrent benzodiazepine, barbiturate or Z‑drug use can synergistically increase sedation and overdose risk; many withdrawal cases involve such combinations, complicating management.[3][14]
- Opioids:
  - Case reports of people using phenibut to self‑manage opioid withdrawal or to “boost” opioid effects describe serious adverse outcomes including trauma during psychosis and hospitalizations.[14]
- Gabapentinoids:
  - While phenibut shares α2δ binding with gabapentin, concurrent use may increase dizziness, sedation and neurologic side effects; formal interaction studies are lacking, but caution is recommended based on overlapping mechanisms.[12][10]

### Contraindications / high‑risk groups

- Populations at elevated risk:
  - Individuals with substance use disorders, severe psychiatric illness, renal impairment, or unstable cardiovascular disease are consistently over‑represented among severe cases and are at higher risk of dangerous outcomes.[15][3][14]
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding:
  - There is little controlled human data on use in pregnancy or lactation; regulatory documents recommend against use due to lack of safety data and potential fetal/infant exposure.[4][10]
- Children and older adults:
  - Limited paediatric data and increased pharmacodynamic sensitivity in children and older adults warrant avoidance outside controlled medical settings; pharmacokinetic data note higher brain penetration in the young and elderly.[6][10]

## Practical user information

### Detection and drug testing

- Standard tests:
  - Phenibut is not detected on standard urine immunoassay panels used for employment or typical clinical toxicology (which focus on opioids, benzodiazepines, THC, cocaine, etc.).[20][10]
- Specialized testing:
  - Detection requires specific analytical methods (e.g., LC–MS/MS or GC–MS) that are typically available only in specialized toxicology or forensic laboratories and may not be routinely ordered.[10]
- Detection window:
  - Given a plasma half‑life of ~5.3 hours and predominantly renal excretion, phenibut and its signal in plasma/urine are expected to decline substantially over 1–2 days after typical therapeutic doses, though detection after heavier or chronic use may persist longer depending on assay sensitivity.[10][3]

### Harm reduction information

- General safer‑use principles (not medical advice, and recognizing that no non‑prescribed use is “safe”):
  - Avoid daily or near‑daily use; many experts advise spacing any non‑prescribed use by at least several days to reduce tolerance and dependence risk, though there is no officially endorsed “safe” schedule.[10][3]
  - Do not exceed low‑gram single doses; doses above typical therapeutic ranges (e.g., >1–1.5 g at once or >2–3 g/day) are repeatedly implicated in dependence and toxicity cases.[3][14]
  - Avoid mixing with alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants due to increased risk of respiratory depression, blackouts and complicated withdrawal.[3][14]
- Warning signs of developing problems:
  - Needing to escalate the dose to achieve the same effect, using phenibut daily or multiple times per day, inability to skip doses without withdrawal‑like symptoms (anxiety, insomnia, tremor), and using despite harms are consistent warning signs of dependence.[3][14]
- When to seek help:
  - Anyone with severe anxiety, insomnia, hallucinations, suicidal thoughts, uncontrolled dose escalation, or suspected withdrawal—especially after high‑dose or long‑term use—should seek urgent medical evaluation; publications emphasize the importance of medical supervision because of the risk of severe withdrawal syndromes.[15][14][3]

### Safer alternatives (for anxiety/sleep – conceptual, not prescribing)

- Medical options:
  - Evidence‑based treatments for anxiety and insomnia include psychological therapies (e.g., CBT), approved medications (e.g., SSRIs/SNRIs, certain non‑benzodiazepine hypnotics) and structured treatment of underlying conditions; these should be discussed with a licensed clinician rather than replaced with unregulated substances such as phenibut.[20][10]
- Non‑prescription options:
  - Non‑sedative supplements such as L‑theanine, magnesium, or certain evidence‑based sleep‑hygiene interventions are often discussed as lower‑risk options, though quality control and individual response vary and formal comparative trials with phenibut are lacking.[20]
  - Any supplement use for mental health should be coordinated with a healthcare professional, especially in people taking other psychoactive medications.[10]

## FAQ data (2025)

1) Is phenibut legal in the United States in 2025?  
- At the federal level, phenibut is not an FDA‑approved drug or dietary ingredient, but it is also not a federally controlled substance, so possession is not generally illegal; however, marketing it as a dietary supplement is unlawful, and some states may have additional restrictions.[2][18][16][20]

2) How long does phenibut withdrawal last?  
- Case reports and a 2024 systematic review suggest acute withdrawal typically begins within 1–3 days of abrupt cessation and, with medical management, often resolves over about 5–14 days, though some individuals report lingering anxiety, sleep disturbance and mood symptoms for weeks or longer.[15][14][3]

3) Can you die from phenibut withdrawal?  
- Published case reports and reviews describe severe withdrawal with psychosis, self‑harm and medical complications, but clear, well‑documented deaths attributable solely to phenibut withdrawal are rare in the peer‑reviewed literature; nonetheless, the severity of symptoms and risk of dangerous behaviors make withdrawal potentially life‑threatening and warrant medical supervision.[15][14][3]

4) How do I taper off phenibut safely?  
- There are no standardized, evidence‑based outpatient taper protocols; published cases usually involve medically supervised substitution with baclofen, benzodiazepines or phenobarbital, with gradual dose reduction tailored to severity and comorbidities, highlighting that any taper should be planned and monitored by a clinician rather than attempted abruptly or without support.[24][14][3]

5) Does phenibut show up on a drug test?  
- Phenibut is not included on standard workplace or clinical immunoassay panels but can be detected with specialized analytical tests (e.g., LC–MS/MS) when specifically ordered, typically within a window of a few days after use depending on the dose and assay sensitivity.[20][10][3]

6) Is phenibut like a benzodiazepine?  
- Phenibut and benzodiazepines can both reduce anxiety and promote sleep, but benzodiazepines act primarily as positive allosteric modulators at GABA-A receptors, whereas phenibut acts mainly as a GABA-B agonist and α2δ ligand; both share risks of dependence and withdrawal, but their pharmacology and approved medical status differ substantially.[11][5][10]

7) What states have banned phenibut?  
- Open‑access policy discussions emphasize that phenibut is unscheduled at the federal level but note that some states—such as Alabama and Kentucky—have moved to restrict or control phenibut; because state laws are evolving and not comprehensively summarized in peer‑reviewed sources, users should consult up‑to‑date state statutes or legal counsel for precise, current information.[2][20]

8) Can I take phenibut with alcohol?  
- Combining phenibut with alcohol significantly increases the risk of CNS and respiratory depression, blackouts, disinhibition and complex withdrawal and is consistently discouraged in clinical case reports and harm‑reduction guidance.[10][14][3]

9) What are safer alternatives to phenibut?  
- For anxiety and insomnia, safer approaches include evidence‑based psychotherapies, approved medications prescribed by a clinician, and non‑sedative lifestyle and behavioral interventions; some people also use supplements such as L‑theanine or magnesium, but these should be discussed with a healthcare professional and are not direct substitutes for professional treatment.[8][20][10]

10) How addictive is phenibut compared to other substances?  
- While there are no large comparative epidemiologic studies, the concentration of case reports describing rapid tolerance, high‑dose escalation and severe withdrawal has led regulators and clinicians to view phenibut as having substantial dependence and abuse potential, broadly comparable to other sedative–hypnotic GABAergic drugs and sufficient to justify scheduling in countries such as Australia.[4][10][14]

Conflicting or uncertain areas include the precise oral bioavailability, the full state‑by‑state legal map in the U.S., and the true incidence and mortality of phenibut withdrawal, which remain limited by small sample sizes and reliance on case reports rather than systematic surveillance.[20][10][14]
