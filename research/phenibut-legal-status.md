Phenibut remains unscheduled at the U.S. federal level and is generally legal to possess and sell nationwide, but it cannot be marketed as a dietary supplement and is banned or tightly controlled in a growing number of countries and at least one U.S. state as of late 2025. Major online retailers (e.g., Amazon) and many supplement platforms prohibit products containing phenibut, and availability is mostly limited to smaller “research chemical” vendors, subject to local import and customs rules.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

Below is a concise framework with the key points you asked for; because laws are actively evolving and detailed penalty tables would require consulting each state and national statute directly, this should be treated as a research scaffold that you expand with primary legal texts and official databases.

## U.S. federal status

- FDA  
  - Phenibut is not an approved drug or dietary ingredient in the U.S. and cannot be legally marketed as a dietary supplement or as an ingredient in dietary supplements.[2][7][1]
  - FDA issued warning letters in 2019 and later years to firms selling phenibut‑containing products as supplements and has treated such products as misbranded or adulterated; certain phenibut products appear on lists of banned or non‑permitted supplement ingredients.[8][1][2]

- DEA  
  - Phenibut is not scheduled under the federal Controlled Substances Act as of 2024–2025, so there is no federal CSA schedule (I–V) classification.[9][10][6]

- FTC  
  - Enforcement around phenibut has focused on FDA misbranding actions and general claims policing; some warning letters have also cited unsubstantiated disease or structure/function claims, but there is no dedicated FTC “phenibut rule.”[8][2]

- Federal legislation attempts  
  - WHO and UN reviews (ECDD pre‑review) have examined phenibut but, to date, it has not been placed under international drug control schedules, and there is no U.S. federal act specifically scheduling phenibut.[10][6]

## U.S. state status (high‑level)

Current detailed state‑by‑state information is fragmented; most sources agree phenibut is generally legal but identify specific state‑level controls, with Alabama clearly scheduled and other states mainly targeting related “gas station drugs” such as tianeptine. For an up‑to‑the‑minute guide you will need to confirm each entry in state code or controlled substance schedules, but the table below gives a starting snapshot.[11][3][12]

Markdown table title: Selected U.S. state phenibut status (research scaffold)

| State | Status (as of 2024–2025) | Classification / law notes | Example penalties (directional) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alabama | Banned / controlled | Phenibut is a Schedule II controlled substance at the state level as of Nov 2021; phenibut added to state schedule.[3][12] | Schedule II possession/sale penalties similar to other state Schedule II drugs; typically felony charges for possession with intent or trafficking (confirm in Alabama Code). |
| Ohio | Likely restricted context, but not clearly scheduled | Some “gas‑station drug” overviews list Ohio among states acting on similar substances (e.g., tianeptine); confirm whether phenibut is explicitly listed in Ohio schedules or sale restrictions.[11][12] | If scheduled, penalties align with state controlled‑substance schedules; otherwise, misbranding/consumer‑protection or analogue provisions may apply. |
| Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Virginia, others | Possible “emerging regulation” focus | Recent materials group these states as acting against tianeptine and similar products sold in convenience stores; some professional summaries imply “several states have taken steps to limit sales,” but do not always show phenibut named in statute.[11][12] | If phenibut is added to a controlled schedule in any of these states, penalties follow that schedule; at minimum, products can be seized if misbranded as supplements. |
| Remaining U.S. states & D.C. | Generally legal, unscheduled (but not as a supplement) | In most states, phenibut is not listed in controlled‑substance schedules and can be possessed/sold as a “research chemical,” subject to FDA rules on supplement marketing and general consumer‑protection laws.[1][13][7] | No drug‑specific penalties if unscheduled; enforcement would focus on misbranding, deceptive trade practices, or, in some cases, analogue laws. |

Because you want a 50‑state table with bill numbers, effective dates, and penalties, the practical method is:

1) For each state, search its controlled‑substance schedule for “phenibut” and “4‑amino‑3‑phenylbutanoic acid.”  
2) Check recent session laws and “gas station drug” bills that may have bundled phenibut with tianeptine or other emerging substances.  
3) Extract: effective date, schedule level, penalties (statutory ranges) and cross‑reference with secondary sources such as state board of pharmacy bulletins or CE materials.[12][11]

## International status (by country / region)

Markdown table title: Phenibut status by country/region (core jurisdictions)

| Country / region | Legal status & classification | Regulation year / notes | Prescription status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Russia | Licensed prescription medicine; used for anxiety, insomnia and related indications.[14][15][16] | Long‑standing use since Soviet era; still prescribed in Russia and some Eastern European countries as of 2023–2024.[15][7] | Prescription‑only psychotropic drug. |
| Germany | Phenibut production, possession, use, trafficking and administration are illegal under the New Psychoactive Substances Act (NpSG); treated as a banned new psychoactive substance.[9][5] | Ban under NpSG predates 2024; includes broad prohibition with narrow exemptions for scientific/technical use.[9] | Not available as a prescription medicine; effectively prohibited outside limited research uses. |
| Australia | Classified in Schedule 9 (prohibited substance) of the Poisons Standard; import, manufacture, possession and supply prohibited except for approved research etc.[14][17] | Implementation date recommended/used was 1 Feb 2018.[14] | No routine prescribing; only highly restricted research/authority use. |
| United Kingdom | Phenibut is not a licensed medicine; MHRA has treated it as a medicinal product, restricting sale without appropriate authorization; it may also fall under the Psychoactive Substances Act depending on interpretation.[14][10] | Regulation via MHRA action predates 2017; exact year of first enforcement against phenibut products is earlier than 2018.[14] | Not a standard prescription medicine; legal status for possession is ambiguous, but commercial sale as an unlicensed medicine is not allowed.[14] |
| France | Identified among countries where phenibut is a controlled substance; listed as illegal in some toxicology and regulatory reviews.[9][12] | Controlled by national narcotics/psychotropics legislation prior to 2024 (exact decree date needs checking in French official journal).[9] | Not available as an ordinary medicine; considered an illicit psychotropic. |
| Italy | Cited as a country where phenibut is illegal/controlled.[9] | Year and specific schedule require checking Italian controlled‑substances tables; reports pre‑2024 describe phenibut as illegal.[9] | No normal prescription channel; effectively prohibited. |
| Hungary | Listed as a country where phenibut is illegal / controlled as a psychotropic.[9][12] | Classified prior to 2024 under national new psychoactive substance or psychotropic regulations.[9] | Not prescribed; possession and supply may attract criminal penalties. |
| Lithuania | Reported as a country where phenibut is illegal; classified under narcotics/psychotropics controls.[9] | Control introduced before 2024; official narcotics list should be consulted for exact year and listing.[9] | Not available via normal prescription channels. |
| Norway | As of Dec 2023, phenibut was reclassified from “medicinal product” to “narcotic,” and private importation is prohibited; shipments can lead to police prosecution.[18] | Narcotic classification and import ban effective Dec 2023.[18] | No private import; any therapeutic use would require strict narcotics prescribing and pharmacy handling (if allowed at all). |
| Other EU countries (general) | Many EU states treat phenibut as an unapproved substance or illegal NPS; Germany, France, Italy, Hungary, Lithuania explicitly list it as illegal, while others may not have specific scheduling but can act under general psychoactive or medicines laws.[9][6] | EMA does not regulate phenibut as an approved medicine; status is fragmented and evolving at national level.[6] | Where unscheduled, it is typically not a licensed medicine; any prescribing would be off‑label import under strict rules. |
| Canada | Phenibut is not an approved natural health product or conventional drug; Health Canada has indicated it does not fit natural health product criteria and treats products containing phenibut as unauthorized.[14][16] | Regulatory notes pre‑2020 already described it as unscheduled but not acceptable as an NHP; more recent NPS bulletins monitor it as an emerging substance.[14][19] | No authorized prescription product containing phenibut; sale in products is subject to seizure/recall as unauthorized drugs. |
| Japan | Some international summaries state phenibut is among substances subject to control as a psychotropic or designated drug, but open‑access English‑language primary citations are sparse; status should be confirmed directly with Japan’s MHLW schedules.[20] | New psychoactive substances (e.g., phenibut) have been added over time to Japan’s designated drug lists; phenibut appears grouped in some Korean and regional documents as already controlled “in the U.S., the U.K., Japan, and other countries.”[20] | Likely no standard prescription product; treated as a controlled or designated substance if scheduled. |
| South Korea | MFDS pre‑announced phenibut for “temporary narcotics” designation, meaning its production, sale and possession fall under narcotics controls.[20] | Temporary narcotics designation press release in Oct 2020, with phenibut among newly controlled substances.[20] | Subject to narcotics‑law handling; not a routine prescription drug. |

For a truly “country‑by‑country” global table you would repeat this workflow: check WHO/UN ECDD reports, national narcotics lists, medicines agencies (MHRA, ANSM, BfArM, AIFA, etc.), and customs pages such as Norway’s, then add columns for “Legal status, Year, Classification, Rx/OTC/Prohibited.”[18][14][5][9][10]

## Availability and retailer / vendor policies

- Where it can still be purchased  
  - Phenibut is commonly sold online as a bulk powder or capsules through smaller “nootropic” or “research chemical” vendors in jurisdictions where it is not controlled (e.g., U.S. federal level, some EU states, U.K. grey market, and parts of Canada), though sellers typically avoid dietary‑supplement branding to reduce regulatory risk.[7][6][1]

- Major retailers (Amazon, etc.)  
  - FDA’s stance that phenibut is not a lawful dietary ingredient has led major platforms and “respectable” supplement brands to remove phenibut‑containing products; contemporary overviews describe phenibut as “pulled from major online retailers” and only available via smaller outlets.[1][2][8]
  - Press releases and public‑health advisories in multiple countries explicitly urge retailers and online platforms not to stock products containing phenibut.[4][1]

- Import and customs  
  - Countries that now classify phenibut as a narcotic or prohibited substance (for example, Norway, Australia, South Korea and some EU states) empower customs to seize shipments and may refer cases for prosecution.[14][20][5][18][9]
  - Even where phenibut is unscheduled, customs agencies can stop parcels if the product is considered an unauthorized medicine or misbranded supplement (e.g., in Canada, the U.K., and much of the EU).[19][6][18][14]

Given your research objective, the most robust way forward is to:

- Build two master tables (50 U.S. states + D.C., and a country list) with columns you specified.  
- For each row, pull directly from primary legal sources (state controlled‑substance schedules, national narcotics lists, medicines‑agency notices) and annotate with links and dates, using secondary medical or regulatory reviews such as the WHO ECDD report or recent toxicology papers only as a cross‑check.[5][6][18][9][14][10]
