Phenibut was used in a variety of Russian/Eastern European prescription products (Noofen, Citrocard, Anvifen, Fenibut, Bifren, others) but is now effectively banned as a legal dietary supplement ingredient in the US and is considered high-risk due to dependence and withdrawal.  For anxiety/sleep/social anxiety, evidence-based safer options include certain supplements (L‑theanine, ashwagandha, magnesium, glycine, melatonin) and standard prescription medications under medical supervision.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]

## Section 1: Phenibut products

### 1.1 US “supplement” products (historical)

Phenibut is not an approved dietary ingredient in the US; FDA has stated that products marketed as dietary supplements that list phenibut as an ingredient are misbranded and must be removed.  FDA has taken enforcement actions and issued warning letters to companies selling phenibut‑containing products, and phenibut is now generally sold only as a “research chemical” powder or capsules online rather than as a mainstream supplement.[10][11][12][1]

- Typical contents and doses:
  - Historically sold as bulk powder and capsules, often 250–750 mg per capsule, with user “doses” in the 250–2000 mg/day range, but there is no approved or safe dosing range because it is not an approved medicine in the US.[4][1]
  - Products were marketed as “sleep aids,” “relaxation,” “nootropics,” or “anti‑anxiety” supplements despite lack of FDA approval.[13][1][4]

- FDA position and warning letters:
  - FDA explicitly ruled that phenibut does not meet the legal definition of a “dietary ingredient”; therefore any “dietary supplement” listing phenibut is adulterated/misbranded.[11][10]
  - FDA has issued multiple warning letters to firms marketing phenibut products, requiring corrective action and removal from supplement listings; individual brand lists can be found by searching FDA’s warning-letter database for “phenibut.”[12][10]

Because of copyright constraints and the dynamic market, a complete brand‑by‑brand historical list is best obtained directly from the FDA warning‑letter search page and archived nootropic vendor lists, rather than reproduced here.[10][12]

### 1.2 International pharmaceutical products

Phenibut (γ‑amino‑β‑phenylbutyric acid) was developed in the former USSR and is used as a prescription anxiolytic and neuropsychotropic agent in some Eastern European countries.[2][4]

Key brand names and countries:[14][2][4]

- Russia / Ukraine / Belarus / Latvia:
  - Anvifen – phenibut hydrochloride capsules/tablets.
  - Fenibut (also “Phenibut‑Akrikhin,” “Phenibut‑VERTEX,” “Phenibut‑LekT”) – various generics. 
  - Bifren – phenibut formulation.
  - Noofen – phenibut capsules, indicated for anxiety, tension, and sleep problems; patient leaflet describes use for anxiety, agitation, fear and sleep improvement.[14]
  - Citrocard – phenibut citrate formulation.[4]

- Indications and dosing:
  - Indications include anxiety disorders, neuroses, insomnia, pre‑operative anxiety, vestibular disorders, sometimes adjunctive use in alcohol withdrawal; dosing in local product information commonly ranges around 250–750 mg per dose, up to about 1.5–2 g/day, but precise regimens are country‑ and product‑specific.[2][4][14]
  - These products are prescription‑only in those markets and are not approved for use in the US or most of Western Europe.[1][2][4]

- Risk profile:
  - Phenibut acts primarily as a GABA\(_B\) receptor agonist and can cause tolerance, dependence, and severe withdrawal (anxiety, agitation, psychosis, insomnia).[15][13][1][4]
  - Because of these risks and lack of regulatory approval, professional bodies and public health agencies advise against non‑medical use.[15][13][1][4]

## Section 2: Safe alternatives

Important: Even “safer” options can interact with medications or underlying conditions. People with significant anxiety, insomnia, or substance‑use history should discuss options with a clinician rather than self‑treat.

### 2.1 Alternatives for anxiety

1) L‑Theanine

- Mechanism:
  - Amino acid from tea; crosses the blood–brain barrier and appears to modulate glutamate and GABA, increase alpha‑wave activity, and promote a relaxed but alert state.[3][16][17]
- Evidence:
  - Controlled human studies show that single doses of L‑theanine can reduce physiological and subjective stress in acute stress tasks, increasing EEG alpha power and reducing state anxiety compared with placebo.[3]
  - In clinical populations (e.g., schizophrenia, generalized anxiety), 400 mg/day as adjunctive therapy reduced anxiety ratings without serious adverse effects.[16]
- Safety:
  - Generally well tolerated in studies up to ~400–900 mg/day; adverse effects comparable to placebo and typically mild.[16][3]
- Legal status:
  - In the US and many countries, sold over the counter as a dietary supplement; not a controlled substance.[12]
- Where to obtain:
  - Widely available as stand‑alone capsules/powders or in “calming” or “focus” blends from pharmacies, online retailers, and health‑food shops.[17][3]

2) Magnesium (especially glycinate/bisglycinate)

- Mechanism:
  - Essential mineral that modulates NMDA and GABAergic signaling and is required for serotonin synthesis and broader neurochemical stability; low magnesium is associated with anxiety and sleep disturbance.[18][9]
- Evidence:
  - A 2024 review concluded that supplemental magnesium is likely useful for mild anxiety and insomnia, particularly when baseline magnesium status is low.[9]
  - A 2025 randomized, double‑blind trial of magnesium bisglycinate (250 mg elemental magnesium plus glycine daily) in adults with insomnia symptoms showed a modest but statistically significant improvement in insomnia scores versus placebo over 4 weeks, with good tolerability.[6]
- Safety:
  - Oral magnesium is generally safe at moderate doses in people with normal kidney function, though higher doses can cause diarrhea or GI upset; people with kidney disease should only use it under medical supervision.[6][18]
- Legal status:
  - Widely available as an OTC dietary supplement in most countries.[18]
- Where to obtain:
  - Pharmacies and online supplement retailers (look for “magnesium glycinate” or “magnesium bisglycinate”).[5][18]

3) Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera)

- Mechanism:
  - Adaptogenic herb; may modulate HPA‑axis activity and cortisol, as well as GABAergic and serotonergic systems, leading to reduced stress and anxiety.[19][7][20]
- Evidence:
  - Multiple randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled trials of high‑concentration ashwagandha root extract (typically 300–600 mg/day) showed significant reductions in stress, anxiety scales, and cortisol, with improved sleep quality versus placebo.[7][20][19]
- Safety:
  - Trials report mainly mild adverse effects and good tolerability; however, rare case reports of liver injury exist, and it should be avoided in pregnancy and in people with certain autoimmune or endocrine conditions unless supervised.[20][19][7]
- Legal status:
  - OTC herbal supplement in the US and many other countries.[7]
- Where to obtain:
  - Standardized root‑extract capsules and powders from pharmacies and supplement vendors.[19][20]

4) Prescription options (when to see a doctor)

- Mechanisms and examples:
  - First‑line pharmacologic treatments for chronic anxiety disorders are usually:
    - SSRIs/SNRIs (e.g., sertraline, escitalopram, venlafaxine) that increase serotonergic (and noradrenergic) signaling.[21][22]
    - Occasionally buspirone or other non‑benzodiazepine anxiolytics, depending on diagnosis.
- Evidence:
  - These agents have robust evidence from large randomized trials for generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, etc., and are recommended in clinical guidelines.[21]
- Safety:
  - They carry side‑effect profiles (GI effects, sexual dysfunction, activation, withdrawal with abrupt stop), but are not associated with the severe dependence profile seen with phenibut.[21]
- When to seek care:
  - Persistent anxiety most days for weeks, functional impairment, suicidal ideation, or history of using high‑risk substances (phenibut, benzodiazepines, alcohol) to self‑medicate are all reasons to see a physician or psychiatrist rather than relying on OTC options.[22][21]

### 2.2 Alternatives for sleep

1) Magnesium (as above)

- Mechanism/evidence:
  - As above, magnesium is involved in sleep regulation; magnesium bisglycinate at 250 mg elemental magnesium improved insomnia severity modestly in a 4‑week RCT, with benefits appearing within ~2 weeks.[6]
- Safety/legal/availability:
  - Generally safe and OTC, with caveats for kidney disease and high doses.[18][6]

2) Glycine

- Mechanism:
  - An inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitter that can lower core body temperature and promote sleep onset and improved sleep architecture.[23][24]
- Evidence:
  - Randomized controlled trials show that 3 g glycine before bed can increase deep and REM sleep, shorten sleep‑onset latency, and reduce next‑day fatigue and sleepiness, without major side effects.[8][24][23]
- Safety:
  - Generally well tolerated at 3 g nightly in studies, with no evidence of dependence or next‑day cognitive impairment.[24][8]
- Legal status/where to obtain:
  - Sold as an OTC amino acid powder or capsules through supplement retailers.[23][8]

3) Melatonin

- Mechanism:
  - Endogenous hormone regulating circadian rhythm; exogenous melatonin can advance or consolidate sleep timing.[25][26]
- Evidence:
  - Systematic reviews and guidelines suggest melatonin (up to ~10 mg) can be effective for sleep‑onset insomnia and circadian‑rhythm issues, particularly in older adults, with generally fewer side effects than traditional hypnotics.[27][26]
- Safety:
  - Short‑term use appears safe for most adults; long‑term safety data are still evolving; it can interact with other drugs and may be unsuitable in autoimmune, seizure, or certain psychiatric conditions.[28][26][25]
  - Dose ranges in practice are often 0.5–3 mg 30–60 minutes before bed, with most adults not needing more than 5 mg.[26][28]
- Legal status/availability:
  - In the US, sold OTC as a dietary supplement; in some countries, lower doses are OTC while higher doses are prescription‑only.[25][26]

4) Prescription sleep options

- Examples:
  - Non‑benzodiazepine hypnotics (e.g., zolpidem), low‑dose sedating antidepressants (e.g., trazodone, doxepin), and others, chosen based on comorbidities.[26]
- Risks:
  - Many have tolerance, dependence, complex sleep behaviors, or hangover risk and are usually reserved for short‑term or carefully monitored use.[26]
- When to see a doctor:
  - Insomnia lasting more than 3 months, significant daytime impairment, safety‑sensitive jobs, or comorbid depression/anxiety are indications to seek professional help rather than escalating OTC aids.[28][26]

### 2.3 Social anxiety / performance anxiety

1) Beta‑blockers (e.g., propranolol)

- Mechanism:
  - Block β‑adrenergic receptors, dampening physical symptoms of adrenergic arousal (tachycardia, tremor) that contribute to performance anxiety.[29][22]
- Evidence:
  - Widely used off‑label for performance‑type social anxiety (public speaking, performance); evidence is stronger for reducing physical symptoms than for generalized social anxiety disorder.[22]
- Safety:
  - Contraindicated or risky in asthma, certain heart conditions, bradycardia, and in people at risk of overdose or self‑harm; UK experts have warned about toxicity in overdose and recommend careful risk assessment, especially in younger patients with depression or self‑harm history.[21]
- Legal status/where to obtain:
  - Prescription‑only cardiovascular drugs; any use for anxiety is off‑label and must be supervised by a doctor.[29][22]

2) L‑Theanine + caffeine

- Rationale:
  - L‑theanine promotes relaxation and reduces stress, while caffeine enhances alertness; together they can improve attention and reduce subjective stress, often used for “calm focus.”[17][3]
- Evidence:
  - Studies of L‑theanine alone show reduced stress and anxiety and increased alpha activity; combination products are common in nootropic formulations, though formal trials specifically on social anxiety are limited.[3][17]
- Safety:
  - Generally well tolerated at moderate caffeine intakes; people sensitive to caffeine, with arrhythmia, or anxiety exacerbated by stimulants should be cautious.[17][3]
- Legal/availability:
  - Widely available as OTC supplements and in certain beverages.[3]

3) When to seek professional help

- Indications:
  - Persistent fear and avoidance of social situations, panic attacks, or major impact on work/study/relationships are typical of social anxiety disorder and warrant assessment by a mental‑health professional.[22][21]
- Treatment:
  - Cognitive‑behavioral therapy (including exposure‑based approaches) has strong evidence for social anxiety; SSRIs/SNRIs are often first‑line medications when needed, with beta‑blockers used situationally.[22][21]

## Section 3: Phenibut vs alternatives – key differences

High‑level comparison based on clinical data and user‑report trends from the medical literature and public‑health summaries:[13][5][8][9][15][1][7][6][3]

| Agent                         | Effectiveness (user/clinical) | Safety profile                         | Addiction/dependence potential            | Legal status (US)                                | Availability                                  |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Phenibut                     | Often strong acute anxiolysis/sedation reported but with rapid tolerance; not supported by high‑quality Western trials. [15][1][13][4] | Narrow margin of safety; overdose and withdrawal can cause severe agitation, psychosis, seizures, and medical emergencies. [15][1][13] | High; clear risk of tolerance, dependence, and severe withdrawal syndrome. [15][1][13] | Not FDA‑approved; banned as dietary supplement ingredient but still legal to possess/buy as non‑dietary “research” product. [1][10][11] | Mostly niche online sellers; not available via legitimate pharmacies in US. [1] |
| L‑Theanine                   | Modest reduction in acute stress and anxiety in trials; some benefit as adjunct in psychiatric conditions. [3][16] | Very good; few and mild adverse effects at studied doses. [3][16] | No evidence of dependence or withdrawal. [3][16] | Legal OTC dietary supplement. [12]       | Widely available OTC and online. [3]    |
| Magnesium (glycinate forms) | Modest benefit for mild anxiety and insomnia, especially in low‑magnesium individuals. [6][9] | Generally safe at standard doses; GI upset at high doses, caution in kidney disease. [6][18] | No dependence; physiological but not addictive. [6][9] | Legal OTC mineral supplement. [18]       | Widely available OTC. [5][18]       |
| Ashwagandha                  | Multiple RCTs show significant stress/anxiety reduction and better sleep versus placebo. [19][7][20] | Generally well tolerated; rare serious adverse events possible; avoid in pregnancy and some conditions. [7][19] | No classic dependence; theoretical risk of misuse is low compared with phenibut. [7][19] | Legal herbal supplement. [7]            | Widely available OTC. [19][20]       |
| Glycine                      | 3 g before bed improves sleep quality and reduces sleep latency and next‑day fatigue. [23][8][24] | Excellent safety profile at studied doses with minimal side effects. [8][24] | No evidence of dependence or withdrawal. [8][24] | Legal OTC amino acid supplement. [23]    | Widely available OTC powders/capsules. [23][8] |
| Melatonin                    | Effective for sleep‑onset insomnia and circadian issues; modest effects overall. [27][26] | Generally safe short‑term; potential interactions and less certain long‑term safety. [25][28][26] | No classic dependence, but psychological reliance possible. [26] | OTC dietary supplement (hormone). [25][26] | Widely available OTC. [25][28]         |
| Beta‑blockers (propranolol) | Good for episodic performance anxiety (physical symptoms); not a cure for generalized social anxiety. [29][22] | Can cause bradycardia, hypotension, fatigue; overdose is dangerous; contraindicated in some conditions. [21][22] | Not classically addictive, but misuse and overdose risk exist. [21][22] | Prescription‑only cardiovascular drug; anxiety use is off‑label. [29][22] | By prescription through licensed clinicians. [29] |
| Standard anxiolytic Rx (SSRIs/SNRIs etc.) | Strong evidence for chronic anxiety disorders. [21] | Known side‑effect profiles; generally safer than phenibut for long‑term use when monitored. [21] | Some discontinuation symptoms; not comparable to phenibut’s acute dependence/withdrawal profile. [21] | Prescription medicines. [21]              | Via physician/psychiatrist. [21]          |
