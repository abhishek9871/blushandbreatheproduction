Perfect! Now let me create a comprehensive written report with all findings.

## The Complete Legal Status of SARMs in 2025: United States & Global Regulations
### Executive Summary
As of November 2025, SARMs remain in a unique regulatory gray area in the United States and most jurisdictions worldwide. Despite two failed legislative attempts to classify them as Schedule III controlled substances (S.2742 in 2018 and S.2895 in 2019), SARMs are currently treated as **unapproved new drugs** under FDA jurisdiction rather than formal controlled substances. However, enforcement has escalated dramatically in 2024-2025, with criminal prosecutions replacing warning letters as the primary FDA strategy. Globally, SARMs are prohibited for human consumption across the United States, Canada, the European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and the United Kingdom, though legal mechanisms differ by jurisdiction. China has not directly banned SARMs but has implemented precursor chemical export controls that indirectly constrain illicit manufacturing.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]

***

## Section 1: United States Federal Legal Status
### 1.1 Current Legal Framework (November 2025)
**SARMs are NOT Schedule III controlled substances under federal law.** Despite repeated legislative attempts, they remain classified as **unapproved investigational new drugs (INDs)** under 21 USC § 355 of the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act (FDCA).[1][8]

The FDA's official position is unambiguous: **SARMs cannot be legally marketed in the United States as dietary supplements or as approved drugs.** This regulatory stance has been consistent since the agency's first coordinated warning letters in 2017. No SARM has ever received FDA approval for human use, and the agency continues to classify them as unapproved drug products posing serious safety risks.[9][8][10]

**Legal Authority for Prosecution:**
- 21 USC § 355 (Unapproved New Drugs)
- 21 USC §§ 337-340 (Criminal and Civil Penalties)
- 21 CFR § 320 (Standards)
- Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-260, effective December 18, 2014)[1]

The DASCA created a framework allowing synthetic steroid analogues to be prosecuted even without explicit Schedule III listing, which prosecutors have leveraged to pursue SARM cases.[11][12]

### 1.2 The SARMs Control Act: Legislative History and Current Status
Two comprehensive bills proposed federal scheduling of SARMs as Schedule III controlled substances, but **both failed to become law.**

**S.2742 - Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators Control Act of 2018:**
- **Sponsor:** Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah)
- **Introduced:** April 24, 2018 (115th Congress)
- **Status:** Introduced, referred to Senate Judiciary Committee; **DIED IN COMMITTEE**
- **Outcome:** Not enacted[1]

**S.2895 - Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators Control Act of 2019:**
- **Sponsors:** Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island)
- **Introduced:** November 19, 2019 (116th Congress)
- **Status:** Introduced but **NOT ENACTED as of November 2025**
- **Key Provisions (if passed):**
  - Add SARMs to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (treating them like anabolic steroids)
  - Establish DEA authority for temporary emergency scheduling (30-day notice) and permanent rulemaking of new SARM analogues
  - Require products to bear nomenclature using International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) standards
  - Criminalize false labeling and unlabeled SARM trafficking
  - Define SARM offenses as felony drug offenses under the CSA
  - Authorize civil penalties[2][3]
- **Current Status:** Remains pending in legislative limbo; no recent action in the 118th or 119th Congress[13]
- **Political Outlook:** While bipartisan sponsorship demonstrates support, passage likelihood remains moderate due to competing legislative priorities (particularly fentanyl precursor controls)[3]

**The Regulatory Gap:** Because neither bill was enacted, SARMs exist in a legislative gray area where they are prosecuted as unapproved drugs under existing FDA authority rather than as explicitly scheduled controlled substances. This actually benefits prosecutors, as they avoid the procedural protections associated with Schedule III designation.

### 1.3 FDA Enforcement Actions (2024-2025 Escalation)
FDA enforcement has dramatically escalated from warning letters to aggressive criminal prosecution.[14]

**Timeline of Enforcement:**

**October 31, 2017 - Initial Warning Letters:**
- Infantry Labs LLC (marketed products "The Officer" and "The Lieutenant" containing ostarine and LGD-4033)

- FDA cited safety concerns about unapproved injectable drug products[15]

**April 2023 - FDA Consumer Warning Update:**
- Agency warned of ongoing adverse event reports targeting teenagers and young adults
- Highlighted social media influencer marketing campaigns promoting SARMs as "safe"[8]

**August 2023 - Criminal Convictions in Multiple Jurisdictions:**
- Texas, North Carolina, and New Jersey cases with sentences up to one year imprisonment[11]
- Demonstrates shift from administrative warnings to criminal prosecutions

**February 2022 - Blackstone Labs Sentencing (Landmark Prosecution):**
- **PJ Braun** (co-founder): **54 months federal prison**
- **Aaron Singerman** (co-founder): **54 months federal prison**
- **Anthony Ventrella** (Ventech Labs manufacturer): **13 months federal prison**
- **Combined Forfeiture:** Approximately **$7 million** (Braun: $3M, Singerman: $2.9M, Blackstone Labs: $1.2M)
- **Judge:** William Dimitrouleas, Southern District of Florida
- **Charges:** Conspiracy to defraud FDA, conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, mail and wire fraud[16]

**December 2021 - Blackstone Labs Jury Conviction:**
- **James Boccuzzi** (former Director of Sales) convicted on:
  - One count of conspiracy to defraud FDA
  - One count of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances
- Maximum penalty: 15 years federal prison[17]
- **Notable:** Only defendant who took case to trial; co-conspirators pleaded guilty

**May 27, 2025 - Recent Prosecution: Tyler Hall / Rat's Army:**
- **Defendant:** Tyler Hall, 31, Greenville, Tennessee
- **Charges:** Federal felony for illegally manufacturing and selling unapproved SARMs and SERMs
- **Method:** Imported raw materials from China, manufactured liquid formulations in Montana and Tennessee facilities
- **Markings:** Products sold to bodybuilding/fitness community with falsified labeling
- **Agency:** FDA Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI)
- **Status:** Pending final sentencing
- **Significance:** Demonstrates ongoing FDA targeting of manufacturers with direct China supply lines[18]

### 1.4 Documented FDA Adverse Events
SARMs have been linked to numerous life-threatening adverse reactions documented in FDA's MedWatch database:[8]

**Documented Reactions:**
- **Liver toxicity** (most frequently reported)
- **Acute liver failure** (documented fatalities in clinical literature)
- **Increased risk of heart attack and stroke**
- **Psychosis and hallucinations**
- **Sexual dysfunction and erectile issues**
- **Testicular shrinkage and atrophy**
- **Male infertility**
- **Pregnancy miscarriage** (in female users)
- **Sleep disturbances and insomnia**

**Underreporting Reality:** FDA acknowledges actual adverse event rates are likely substantially higher due to:
- Consumer reluctance to report unprescribed drug use
- Incomplete understanding that symptoms result from SARM use
- Limited consumer awareness of MedWatch reporting mechanism

**Reporting:** Healthcare professionals and consumers can report adverse events to FDA's MedWatch program at **1-800-FDA-0178** or online at MedWatch.FDA.gov.

***

## Section 2: Military (Department of Defense) Prohibitions
### Absolute Prohibition for Service Members
The Department of Defense maintains the strictest prohibition against SARMs through a multi-layered regulatory framework.[19][20][21]

**Legal Authority:**
- **DoD Instruction 6130.06:** "Use of Dietary Supplements in the DoD" (effective 2013, regularly updated)
- **UCMJ Article 112a:** Wrongful Use, Possession, Distribution, Manufacturing of Controlled Substances
- **Operation Supplement Safety (OPSS) Website:** Maintains the official DoD Prohibited Dietary Supplement Ingredients List (updated quarterly as new scientific evidence emerges)

**Specific Status of SARMs:**
- **ALL SARMs are listed on the DoD Prohibited Dietary Supplement Ingredients List**
- Service members are **absolutely prohibited** from using any dietary supplement containing listed ingredients
- The list currently includes more than 800 substances[21]
- Military exchange (AAFES) retail policies updated (2022 forward) to prohibit selling products containing prohibited ingredients[21]

### Penalties for Service Member Violations
**Under UCMJ Article 112a, violations carry severe consequences:**

For Schedule III substance equivalents:
- **Dishonorable discharge** (permanent separation with stigma)
- **Forfeiture of all pay and allowances**
- **Confinement: up to 5 years** in federal military prison
- **Reduction in rank** to lowest enlisted grade
- **Security clearance revocation** (violates "loyalty to service" and "compliance with law" requirements)[20][21]

**Secondary Consequences:**
- Ineligibility for military benefits
- Permanent military disciplinary record
- Career-limiting impact on re-entry to civilian service/federal employment
- Background check implications for future employment

### Testing Protocols
- **Primary Method:** Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GCMS) urine testing
- **Emerging Method:** Hair testing (longer detection windows)
- **Detection Windows:** 5-22+ days depending on specific SARM compound[19]
- **Testing Frequency:** Random urinalysis remains standard; increased screening for suspected users

***

## Section 3: State-Level Bans
### Louisiana and Mississippi SARMs Scheduling
**LOUISIANA:**
- SARMs are incorporated into state controlled substance scheduling
- Legal framework follows federal Controlled Substances Act structure
- Penalties: State prosecution under Louisiana Controlled Substances Law
- No separate state-specific SARM statute identified beyond federal CSA adoption[22]

**MISSISSIPPI:**
- **Legal Authority:** Mississippi Code § 41-29-139 (Prohibited Acts)
- **Classification:** Schedule III Controlled Substances (mirrors federal framework)
- **Trafficking Penalties (by quantity):**
  - 250-500 grams: 3-10 years imprisonment + fines up to $15,000
  - 500g-1kg: 4-16 years imprisonment + fines up to $250,000
  - 1kg-5kg: 6-24 years imprisonment + fines up to $500,000
- **Possession penalties:** Vary by quantity and prior offense history[23]

**Broader State Context:**
- Most U.S. states have adopted federal Controlled Substances Act scheduling for drugs
- No states identified additional SARMs-specific statutes separate from federal CSA framework as of November 2025
- Prosecution typically occurs under federal law in most jurisdictions
- State charges can be concurrent or consecutive with federal charges

***

## Section 4: WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) Prohibitions
**All SARMs are universally prohibited in athletics under WADA's 2025 Prohibited List** (effective January 1, 2025).[24][25][26]

**Classification and Scope:**
- **WADA Category:** S1.2 (Anabolic Agents)
- **Prohibition:** Both in-competition and out-of-competition
- **Explicit Examples:** Ostarine (MK-2866), Ligandrol (LGD-4033), RAD-140 (Testolone), MK-677 (Ibutamoren), Cardarine (GW501516)
- **2025 List Update:** Additional clarifications and examples added to help athletes identify prohibited substances[24]

**Consequences of Violations:**
- Athlete disqualification
- Competition results nullification
- Sport federation suspensions (typically 2-4 years)
- Loss of sponsorships and prize money
- Permanent record implications

***

## Section 5: China Export Restrictions & Global Supply Chain Impact
### Critical Clarification: No Direct SARMs Ban, but Precursor Controls
**Important distinction:** China has NOT directly banned SARMs as finished products for export. However, controls on pharmaceutical precursor chemicals have indirect impacts on illicit SARM manufacturing capacity.[4][5][6]

### Timeline of China's Regulatory Actions
**September 1, 2024 - New Precursor Chemical Controls:**

China's Ministry of Commerce and General Administration of Customs added 7 substances to the controlled precursor chemicals list (Regulations on Administration of Precursor Chemicals):[4][6]

1. **N-phenylpiperidin-4-amine (4-AP)** - CAS 23056-29-3 - Used in pharmaceutical synthesis, now controlled for fentanyl production prevention
2. **1-boc-4-piperidone** - CAS 125541-22-2
3. **Norfentanyl** - CAS 1609-66-1
4. **Cannabidiol (CBD)** - CAS 13956-29-1
5. **BMK glycidic acid and esters** - CAS 25547-51-7
6. **3-oxo-2-phenylbutanoic acid and esters** - CAS 4433-88-9
7. **PMK glycidic acid esters**

**Critical Note:** These seven substances are primarily **fentanyl precursors**, not direct SARM synthesis precursors. However, they affect broader pharmaceutical chemistry sourcing capacity.

**June 20, 2025 - Additional Controls (Effective July 20, 2025):**

Reconfirmed and expanded controls on pharmaceutical precursors:[4]
- **4-piperidone (4-AP)** and **1-boc-4-piperidone** classified as **Category II Precursor Chemicals**
- **Requirements:** Production, distribution, purchase, transportation, import, and export all require licensing
- **Global Impact:** Affects legitimate pharmaceutical manufacturers worldwide; creates sourcing bottlenecks

**November 2025 - Export Licensing for Specific Countries:**

China implemented enhanced export licensing requirements for 13 precursor chemicals destined for:[5]
- **United States**
- **Mexico**
- **Canada**
- (Also applied to: Myanmar, Laos, Afghanistan)

### Impact on SARMs Supply Chain
**Direct Impact - Modest:**
- SARMs themselves are not directly prohibited from export
- No comprehensive "SARMs export ban" exists

**Indirect Impact - Growing:**
- Precursor chemical sourcing increasingly difficult for Chinese manufacturers
- Manufacturing costs rising due to licensing/compliance requirements
- Supply chain delays expected
- Black market price increases likely
- Legitimate pharmaceutical companies have robust diversified supply chains and minimal impact

**The Manufacturing Reality:**
- Most illicit SARMs originate from Chinese underground pharmaceutical manufacturers
- These operations rely heavily on accessible precursor chemicals
- Precursor controls create operational constraints and increased costs
- Some manufacturers shifting to precursor substitutes or modified synthesis pathways
- Overall trend: Constrained but not eliminated supply chain

**No Specific SARMs Export Ban Found:** Research did not identify a direct, comprehensive China government ban on SARM raw materials or finished products as of November 2025. However, China's broader precursor chemical control regime indirectly pressures illicit manufacturers.

***

## Section 7: Key Enforcement Trends and Patterns (2024-2025)
### Shift from Administrative to Criminal Enforcement
**Pre-2020:** FDA issued primarily warning letters; industry seen as remediable through administrative correction

**2020-2023:** Mixed enforcement; warnings continued but criminal prosecutions increased

**2024-2025:** Aggressive criminal prosecution is now primary FDA strategy; warning letters largely abandoned for major manufacturers[30][18][11]

### Target Focus
FDA enforcement priorities have shifted strategically:
- **Manufacturers** (maximum supply chain disruption)
- **Distributors/suppliers** (breaking logistics chains)
- **Online retailers** (high-volume cases involving social media marketing)
- **False "research only" labeling** (prosecuting intent through marketing analysis)[20][31]

### Sentencing Trends and Precedents
- **Blackstone Labs founders:** 54 months each (federal prison)
- **Manufacturer defendants:** 12-54 months federal imprisonment
- **Civil forfeiture:** $1-7 million in proceeds recovered
- **Pattern:** Sentences increasing in severity as judicial precedent solidifies[16]

### Evidence Used in Prosecution
Federal prosecutors have developed sophisticated evidence collection strategies:
- **Import records** showing China sourcing
- **Manufacturing facility inspections** documenting conditions
- **Marketing materials** (social media posts, influencer partnerships, website claims)
- **False labeling** ("for research only" on products sold to humans)
- **Adverse event reports** linked to specific products
- **Banking records** showing revenue streams

### Multi-Agency Coordination
- FDA Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI)
- DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration)
- US Postal Inspection Service (mail-based distribution)
- FBI (larger conspiracy cases)
- Customs and Border Protection (CBP) (importation surveillance)

***

## Section 8: Legal Gray Areas and Interpretation Issues
### 1. "Research Only" Label Loophole
**Problem:** Products labeled "not for human consumption" are openly marketed to and purchased by bodybuilders

**FDA Position:** Label disclaimer is insufficient if the actual intent is human consumption

**Court Interpretation:** Intent to distribute to humans = federal crime, regardless of packaging claims[18]

**Case Precedent:** In 2024, defendant Kosolcharoen admitted to intentionally mislabeling injectable cord blood products as "for research purposes only" while knowingly distributing them for medical procedures. Court convicted on fraudulent misbranding. This logic directly applies to SARMs.[32]

**Risk:** Even if labeled "research chemical," if marketed to fitness/bodybuilding communities or sold online without age verification, prosecution possible

### 2. Compound Variants and SARM Analogues
**Problem:** New SARM analogues constantly emerging (examples: YK-11, S-23, AC-262, etc.)

**Legal Framework:** Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act (2014) criminalizes synthetic steroid analogues not explicitly named, using chemical similarity tests

**DEA Authority:** Can emergency schedule new compounds (30-day notice period)

**If SARMs Control Act Passes:** Would expand DEA authority significantly, enabling rapid scheduling of novel SARM variants[2][3]

### 3. Dietary Supplement Claim Prohibition
**Federal Prohibition:** Marketing any SARM as a dietary supplement violates FDCA

**Mechanism:** Product marketed as supplement + health claim = automatic violation (unapproved drug + false claim)

**Prosecutorial Strategy:** Marketing materials used as evidence of intent to violate; companies advertising on social media or through influencers face higher prosecution risk

### 4. International Shipping Liability
**Federal Felony:** Importing or exporting SARMs, even in personal-use quantities, constitutes federal crime[5][31]

**Liability:** Both sender and receiver can face federal charges

**CBP Seizures:** Increasing; packages from China intercepted regularly

**Criminal Charges:** Possible for single-purchase importation

### 5. China Source Documentation as Evidence
**Prosecutorial Strategy:** Acknowledging China purchase documented in shipping records or emails = evidence of intent to distribute

**Import Documentation:** Seized and used as evidence of knowing violation

**Personal Possession with Import Records:** Transforms to distribution charge through documentary evidence

### Critical Legal Reality for Potential Users
- **Possession for personal use = federal crime** (unapproved drug violation)
- **Can be prosecuted under existing CSA framework** without Schedule III classification
- **Federal penalties: up to 5 years** for first offense (if treated as Schedule III equivalent under analogue principles)
- **State charges possible concurrently** or consecutively
- **Collateral consequences severe:** Permanent criminal record, ineligibility for federal student loans/jobs/benefits, security clearance disqualification

**Reporting Adverse Events:** FDA MedWatch at 1-800-FDA-0178 or online

***

## Conclusion: The 2025 Legal Reality for SARMs
As of November 2025, the legal status of SARMs can be summarized as follows:

**United States:** Unapproved drugs facing escalating criminal prosecution without formal Schedule III classification; both federal and state penalties significant; military and sports prohibitions absolute; limited legislative progress on comprehensive scheduling despite bipartisan support.

**Globally:** Prohibited for human consumption across all major English-speaking jurisdictions and the EU; enforcement varies by country but uniformly high in developed nations; China supply chain increasingly constrained through indirect precursor controls rather than direct SARM bans.

**Enforcement Trend:** Shift from warning letters to criminal prosecution demonstrates heightened commitment to enforcement; 54-month federal sentences for major manufacturers establish precedent for substantial penalties.

**Legislative Outlook:** SARMs Control Act remains pending but unlikely to pass in 2025-2026 without significant shift in congressional priorities; current FDA authority under existing law sufficient for prosecution.

**Medical Status:** No SARM approved for human use by FDA, EMA, or any major regulatory authority; all clinical trials halted or suspended; documented adverse events continue.

**Recommendation:** Use of SARMs outside FDA-approved clinical trials constitutes federal crime with severe legal, professional, and health consequences.
