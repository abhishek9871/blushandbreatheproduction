That doesn’t mean throwing out the rules. “You absolutely need to have boundaries when you’re raising an intuitive eater,” she said. “They just need to be rooted in helping them become independent, competent eaters.”</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Protein, fiber, fat: choose two</h2> <p>Arnold, who has three children aged three to seven, said she tries to ensure each snack she feeds them has at least two of three in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/apr/15/truth-about-protein-how-to-get-enough-every-age\">protein</a>, fiber and fat categories. These foods will support muscle growth, digestion and brain development, and keep kids full longer. “I use that as a kind of rule, to help me structure snacks in a simple way,” she said, adding that yes, kids need carbohydrates too, “but they usually don’t need help consuming carbs,” she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter-us/2025/nov/11/best-juicers-to-buy\">The five best juicers in the US with the least mess, noise and cleanup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Taylor said she also tries to include a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/24/five-ways-to-get-your-children-to-eat-vegetables\">fruit or vegetable</a> in every snack, to make sure her children are getting enough fiber and nutrients. “Those broad rules are not only for me to make sure they’re getting what their body needs, but it’s also teaching them how to build a balanced snack.”</p> <p>Taylor <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMIPPdER9WJ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\">recommends</a> an array of fresh and homemade snacks – apple “pizzas” with yogurt and chocolate chips, anyone? – but she said there are many convenient packaged snacks that can also form part of a balanced diet.</p> <p><em>All prices current at the time of publication.</em></p> <p>Here’s what’s in her family’s pantry:</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/stonyfield-organic-whole-milk-strawberry-beet-berry-kids-39-yogurt-4ct-3-7oz-pouches/-/A-15121683?sid=2850S&amp;TCID=PDS-19859758219&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=19859758219&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD-5dfb_roXi-nI5uzFbqIo7vcccw&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAzrbIBhA3EiwAUBaUdbwJsEZEBxGRa2ARky5CwuBvvDEpyqtD0Bhk022aoj0C-T27O4qy2hoCvskQAvD_BwE\">Stonyfield yogurt pouches</a></h2>    <p>“I love the Stonyfield yogurt pouches because they’re whole milk.

The products are also appearing in vending machines and are being handed out as freebies at fitness studios.</p> <h2>What exactly is protein water and do we need it?</h2> <p>The accredited dietitian Daisy Coyle, who is also a research fellow at the George Institute, says protein water is “almost a mashup between a protein shake and a sports drink as they have the protein of a traditional protein shake with the hydration and fruity flavour of a sports drink”.</p> <p>“These products are surging in popularity within the health and fitness industry and are often marketed as a lighter alternative to traditional protein shakes, which are a lot heavier, milkier and higher in calories.”</p> <p>But as Dr Evangeline Mantzioris, a sports dietitian at the University of South Australia, points out: “Australians don’t need more protein.”</p> <p>“About 99% of the healthy Australian population get the protein they need in their diet,” she says.</p> <p>“Per serve, these drinks seem to contain about 20 grams of protein, and that’s a significant amount. For someone who was struggling to get protein in, because they might have an illness, for example, this may be useful. But if you don’t need it, your body just stores it as fat.”</p> <p>This counteracts the claims on some protein drinks that the products help with weight loss and building lean muscle mass, she says.</p> <h2>Weight-loss claims ‘misleading’</h2> <p>Danielle Shine, a PhD candidate researching nutrition misinformation on social media and an accredited dietitian and nutritionist, says positioning protein waters as effective weight-loss aids is misleading, especially when compared with whole-food sources of protein.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/15/pregnancy-skincare-products-target-women-vulnerable-time-truth-myths\">Pregnancy skincare products target women at a vulnerable time.

Prolonged high sodium intakes can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of heart disease, particularly in people with hypertension.”</p> <h2>No substitute for a healthy diet</h2> <p>Mantzioris says because the products are so expensive people often commit to finishing the entire canister. </p> <p>“People pick the one product and consume all of it in a large amount continuously, as opposed to having a bit of cheese from this area, and chicken that comes from over there, and fish that comes from the sea.”</p> <p>Instead of the protein craze, she says she wishes people would focus on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/22/the-fibre-phenomenon-30-easy-ways-to-get-your-fill-of-this-life-changing-nutrient\">getting more fibre</a>.</p> <p>“Australians get on average 11 grams of fibre per day, and we need to be having somewhere between 25 and 30 grams.

Today, a third of greenhouse gas emissions come from the global food system and taming the climate crisis is impossible without changing how the world eats, the researchers said. Food production is also the biggest cause of the destruction of wildlife and forests and the pollution of water.</p> <p>The planetary health diet (PHD) sets out how the world can simultaneously improve the health of people and the planet, and provide enough food for an expected global population of 9.6 billion people by 2050.</p> <p>The diet is flexible, allowing it to be adapted to local tastes, and can include some animal products or be vegetarian or vegan. However, all versions advise eating more vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes and whole grains than most people in the world currently eat. In many places, today’s diets are unhealthy and unsustainable due to too much meat, milk and cheese, animal fats and sugar.</p> <p>People in the US and Canada eat more than seven times the PHD’s recommended amount of red meat, while it is five times more in Europe and Latin America, and four times more in China. However, in some regions where people’s diets are heavily reliant on starchy foods, such as sub-Saharan Africa, a small increase in chicken, dairy and eggs would be beneficial to health, the report found.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/10/planetarydiet-zip/giv-3255427qx3AfwMwaJ/\" data-alt=\"Chart shows different parts of the world and how much they eat from which food groups, as described in the fifth paragraph of the article\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/10/planetarydiet-zip/giv-3255427qx3AfwMwaJ/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Severe inequalities in the food system must also be ended to achieve healthy and sustainable diets, the researchers said. The wealthiest 30% of the world’s population generates more than 70% of food-related environmental damage, it found. Furthermore, 2.8 billion people cannot afford a healthy diet and 1 billion are undernourished, despite enough food being produced globally. The food system is also failing the 1 billion people living with obesity, the report said.</p> <p>The report recommends shifting taxes to make unhealthy food more costly and healthy food cheaper, regulating the advertising of unhealthy food and using warning labels, and the shifting of today’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/16/1m-a-minute-the-farming-subsidies-destroying-the-world\">massive agricultural subsidies</a> to healthier and more sustainable foods.</p>    <p>“What we put on our plates can save millions of lives, cut billions of tonnes of emissions, halt the loss of biodiversity, and create a fairer food system,” said Prof Johan Rockström, who co-chaired the <a href=\"https://eatforum.org/eat-lancet/lancet-commissioners/\">EAT-Lancet Commission</a> that produced the report. “The evidence is undeniable: transforming food systems is not only possible, it’s essential to securing a safe, just, and sustainable future for all.”</p> <p>“This is not a deprivation diet,” said Prof Walter Willett of the Harvard TH Chan school of public health, and another commission co-chair. “This is something that could be delicious, aspirational and healthy. It also allows for cultural diversity and individual preferences, providing flexibility.”</p> <p>The report, <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/commissions-do/EAT-2025\">published in the Lancet</a>, was produced by 70 leading experts from 35 countries and six continents. It builds on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/16/new-plant-focused-diet-would-transform-planets-future-say-scientists\">2019 report</a> that introduced the PHD, but includes new evidence of the health benefits of the diet.</p> <p>“We have been able to look at this diet in relation to health outcomes such as total mortality, diabetes, respiratory diseases, heart disease, stroke, etc and we found very strong inverse relationships” said Willett. The diet was also linked to reduced cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.</p> <p>Overall, the researchers <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38960579/\">estimated global adoption</a> of the PHD could <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39621925/\">prevent 15m early deaths a year</a> in adults. The estimate did not include the impact of the diet reducing obesity, meaning it is probably an underestimate.</p> <p>The PHD recommends plant-rich, flexible diets, including: </p> <ul> <li><p>Fruits and vegetables – at least five portions a day</p></li> <li><p>Whole grains – three to four portions a day</p></li> <li><p>Nuts – one portion per day</p></li> <li><p>Legumes (beans, peas, lentils) – one portion per day</p></li> <li><p>Dairy – one serving of milk, yoghurt or cheese portions a day</p></li> <li><p>Eggs – three to four a week</p></li> <li><p>Chicken – two portions a week</p></li> <li><p>Fish – two portions a week</p></li> <li><p>Red meat – one portion a week</p></li> </ul> <p>Dr Marco Springmann from UCL in the UK and an author of the report said the differences between the PHD and current diets vary: “What needs to be reduced differs a lot. In low income countries, it’s the starchy foods and grains, whereas in high income countries it is animal-sourced foods, sugar, saturated fats, and dairy. It’s insane how much dairy is consumed in Europe and North America.”</p> <p>The data underlying the report is <a href=\"https://trainingidn.shinyapps.io/planetary_health_diets/\">available online</a> and can be used to tailor different planetary health diets for the tastes of people in specific countries and of different ages. The website also shows how much the diets reduce deaths, improve nutrition, and cut environmental impacts. “Hopefully this will lead to more science-based policymaking,” said Springmann.</p>    <p>The PHD is better than current average diets for many nutrients, including fatty acids, fibre, folate, magnesium and zinc. Adequate iron and vitamin B12 could be provided by green leafy vegetables, fermented soy foods and algae, the researchers said.</p> <p>Moving diets towards the PHD could be achieved by helping consumers make better everyday choices, said Prof Line Gordon, director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, for example by shifting taxes to make healthy foods cheaper, and putting warning labels on unhealthy foods. “But it is not just about getting prices lower, it’s also about bringing purchasing power up so that people can afford a healthier diet” she said.</p> <p>“Our recommendations are grounded in scientific evidence and real-world experience,” Gordon said. “Changes are already under way, from school meal programmes to regenerative agriculture and food waste reduction initiatives.” England banned <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c89d54gv44qo\">price promotions on unhealthy foods</a> on Wednesday and will <a href=\"https://healthmedia.blog.gov.uk/2024/12/06/here-are-the-facts-about-our-junk-food-ban/\">ban advertising such foods online</a>.</p> <p>The report estimates that food-related ill health and environmental damage costs society about $15tn a year. It said investments to transform the food system would cost $200bn to $500bn a year, but save $5tn.</p> <p>Alongside a shift in diets, the report calls for other changes to the food system, including cutting the loss and waste of food, greener farming practices, and decent working conditions, as a third of food workers earn below living wages.</p> <p>The launch of the PHD in 2019 led to <a href=\"https://changingmarkets.org/report/meat-vs-eat-lancet-the-dynamics-of-an-industry-orchestrated-online-backlash/\">attacks from meat industry interests</a>. Rockström said: “The [new report] is a landmark achievement. It is a state-of-the-art scientific assessment that quantifies healthy diets for all human beings in the world and the environmental boundaries all food systems need to meet to stay safe. So we have a really rigorous foundation for our [results].

The rate of severe depression is double pre-fire levels, while anxiety is up tenfold compared to earlier benchmarks, according to the study, titled <a href=\"https://uhero.hawaii.edu/from-crisis-to-recovery-health-and-resilience-two-years-after-the-maui-wildfires/\">From Crisis to Recovery: Health and Resilience Two Years After the Maui Wildfires</a>.</p> <p>MauiWES is one of largest post-disaster exposure studies of its kind, and an effort to understand and address the impacts on health and social conditions caused by the deadliest American wildfire in more than a century. At least 102 people died and more than 2,200 homes were destroyed on 8 August 2023 after 50mph winds supercharged a fire that ripped through the historic town of Lahaina in west Maui, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/08/maui-wildfire-six-months-later-housing\">leaving thousands without shelter</a>, work, or access to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/08/maui-wildfire-survivors-health-depression-respiratory-kidney\">adequate health</a> and other basic services.</p> <p>Two years on, more than 40% of adults still lack stable housing and 25% of those looking for work remain unemployed. The number of households unable to afford enough nutritious food – also known as food insecurity – is on the rise, with almost one in four adults regularly skipping meals or going entire days without food due to financial hardship – double the pre-fire rate.</p> <p>Despite some signs of progress and healing, four times as many adults still experience suicidal thoughts compared to before the fire – pointing to deep psychological scars and a need for sustained, culturally appropriate long-term mental health care, according to the report. Failing to address the ongoing psychological trauma – and the housing, economic and food crises caused by the fire – could lead to a future surge in strokes, chronic respiratory disease and other cardiovascular problems.</p> <p>Worryingly, heart and lung issues linked to fire and ash exposure have already become more pronounced.</p> <p>More than 70% of 1,800 survivors in the study now have hypertension – or high blood pressure, while one in four have reduced lung function. The findings come as authorities prepare to move piles of contaminated debris from near Lahaina to central Maui, raising concern among residents about further exposure to environmental toxins.</p> <p>Despite successful efforts to expand coverage, one in six participants remains uninsured, rising to 45% among Latino residents. Nearly a third report persistent issues accessing care or medications – mostly as a result of the fire, the report found.</p> <p>The second tranche of UH findings come after a separate study<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/29/sexual-violence-lahaina-hawaii-wildfires\"> published exclusively by the Guardian </a>last month showed that sexual exploitation of women and domestic violence soared after the Lahaina <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hawaii-fires\">wildfire</a> in 2023. This work is part of a growing effort to better understand and intervene in the health and social consequences of climate-fueled disasters that are wreaking short and long term havoc across the US and globally.</p> <p>In general, women and children are disproportionately impacted by disasters. With almost 200 10- to 17-year-olds now enrolled in the Maui health study, the findings provide the first comprehensive snapshot of child survivors that suggests a hidden mental health crisis which requires urgent attention.</p> <p>Around 45% of the children are experiencing PTSD symptoms, with one in 10 severely impacted by the trauma they have experienced. Half meet the clinical threshold for depression, while 30% struggle with anxiety symptoms such as palpitations, nausea and difficulty breathing. Girls and children identifying as Asian, Filipino and Latino consistently carry the heaviest emotional burden, pointing to the need for culturally grounded, gender-sensitive mental health care in schools and other community jobs.</p> <p>Yet amidst these pressures, Maui’s community bonds remain strong, according to the report, with 90% of participants reporting moderate or high levels of social support. This strong support – anchored in <em>ohana</em> (family), culture and community networks – can serve as a buffer against the long-term health consequences of disaster, but is not enough.</p> <p>Investments in long-term care access, chronic disease screening and respiratory follow-up are critical to avoid deepening health disparities and to promote sustained recovery for Maui’s fire-affected communities, researchers found.</p> <p>“The people of Lahaina have shown extraordinary strength in the face of unimaginable loss. The progress we’re seeing is real – and it’s a testament to the resilience of this community, but the recovery is far from over,” said Ruben Juarez, co-author and professor of economics at the UH Economic Research Organization.</p>","source":"The Guardian","author":""},{"id":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/09/robbie-williams-britpop-tour-comeback-has-it-all","title":"Masculinity, mental health, cat food – Robbie Williams’s comeback has it all | Lauren O'Neill","description":"He’s still perfectly capable of putting his foot in his mouth, but the more he reveals of himself the more we seem to love him, says culture writer Lauren O’Neill","imageUrl":"https://media.guim.co.uk/579d5ed256b99d0577713445a062bf79e5698d50/0_0_4047_3238/500.jpg","category":"Nutrition","date":"2025-06-09","content":"<p>Few facts feel more perfect than this: Robbie Williams’s current stadium and arena tour is sponsored by a cat food. Yes, the Britpop tour, promoting Williams’s upcoming album of the same title, is brought to us by Felix (he joins the brand’s feline mascot in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TehgT_TCQO4\">a new campaign</a>). The show has just spent two nights in residence at London’s Emirates Stadium, having previously stopped off in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/01/robbie-williams-review-dazzling-superstar-glow-from-the-king-of-entertainment\">Edinburgh</a>. It will also see dates in Manchester, Bath, Newcastle and Dublin, as well as other cities in Europe, many of which are sold out.</p> <p>I mention the cat food thing because it feels pretty intrinsic to Williams’s popular persona, and how he’s perceived right now. It is, by anyone’s standards, entirely camp in that particularly British, “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jul/07/hun-culture-british-tv-denise-welch-alison-hammond-matriarchs-kim-woodburn\">hun culture</a>” type of way, where glamour goes hand in hand with ordinariness – and that’s exactly where Robbie’s appeal lies in 2025, as he experiences what appears to be a cultural comeback.</p> <p>Indeed, over the past year or so, and particularly over the past six months, Williams has experienced a resurgence, something he himself acknowledges: “Robbie Williams,” he laughed on stage on Friday night. “Back in stadiums, eh?”</p> <p>That’s not the only bit of evidence, however. He’s <a href=\"https://www.glastofestfeed.com/news/rumours/glastonbury-2025-secret-sets-patchwork/\">rumoured</a> to be playing a secret slot at this year’s Glastonbury; he was recently honoured with the PRS for Music Icon award at the Ivors; and while his biopic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/28/better-man-review-robbie-williams-monkeys-around-in-a-raw-and-emotional-biopic\">Better Man</a> was commercially unsuccessful, it went down pretty well with critics, who praised it for its candour about class and addiction. Williams shows up on cosy TV shows such as Michael McIntyre’s The Wheel, not to mention the cat food adverts, but he’s also found an audience with generation Z, as the subject of social media posts featuring archive photos of 90s and 00s fashion and celebrity culture. His appeal in 2025 has become widespread; his music still endures (play Angels in any pub in Britain and it’ll have the same effect as telling everyone there’s a free bar). You could, then, call it a bit of a Robnaissance.</p> <p>This is all happening because Williams occupies a unique position. He’s a charisma machine who regularly plays in front of thousands, but he’ll also happily divulge to his crowds that he’s – and I quote – “knackered” after playing certain songs, and exchanges concerns about erectile dysfunction with a lip-fillered, AI version of his future self in a between-songs bit. If someone from a younger, more self-serious generation – Sam Fender, Harry Styles – were being sponsored by Pedigree Chum it would probably raise a few eyebrows, but for Williams, stuff like the Felix partnership is entirely on brand. The first person, after all, to nudge and wink at Robbie is Robbie.</p> <p>There is a whole section in his show about how he no longer cares for being cool, while dressed in a hot pink suit. On stage, he delightedly acknowledges that his audience is primarily made up of middle-aged mums – “and I love it!” He speaks candidly about his poor mental health <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/share/BAK6rvgPXX\">on Instagram</a>. Interestingly and marvellously, it’s in this total abandon that his star is rising again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/01/robbie-williams-review-dazzling-superstar-glow-from-the-king-of-entertainment\">Robbie Williams review – dazzling superstar glow from the ‘King of Entertainment’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And this could, it should be acknowledged, very easily not have happened. For a while, he wasn’t well received by the public – a video of him singing as his wife Ayda Field gave birth to their child went down online like a ton of bricks, as did a gag where he used hand sanitiser after touching hands with a New Year’s Eve audience on TV. It was only in 2022 that he was widely criticised for performing in Qatar at the football World Cup, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/18/robbie-williams-defends-decision-to-perform-in-qatar-during-world-cup\">responding to the feedback</a> thus: “If we’re not condoning human rights abuses anywhere, then it would be the shortest tour the world has ever known: I wouldn’t even be able to perform in my own kitchen.”</p> <p>Since then, however, the tide has turned. Williams has publicly shown his softer side again. A 2023 <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81638710\">Netflix documentary</a> about his life saw him reviewing photos and footage on his laptop, in bed in his underwear. There’s also the aforementioned mental health chat online, and, of course, Better Man was further insight into his struggles at the hands of the press and the music industry. Broadly, the vulnerability that he has always embraced in his music (“I don’t wanna die, but I ain’t keen on living either”) has become more and more in vogue for men and male celebrities, in response to the frightening versions of masculinity spawning online. It seems that the mainstream masculinity of the day has caught up with the man who openly sang in 2002: “If you don’t need me, I don’t exist.”</p> <p>Williams will probably always have the ability to put his foot in his mouth spectacularly. But the more he reveals of himself, the more he cements his place as a unique and – let’s face it – unparalleled British performer. There is nobody who does what he does, nobody with his legacy or catalogue, nobody who straddles cool and uncool in quite the same way that Brits love so much.</p> <p>From where I am standing, then, Williams’s popularity in the current moment is deserved and hard won, for a performer who has the type of gift you cannot teach. When he emerged on stage in front of 60,000 people on Friday night, he introduced himself simply: “I’m Robbie Williams. This is my band, this is my arse.” He also told us: “I want to be the king of entertainment.” And at this point, you do have to ask: who else could it be? This is his Robnaissance – we’re just living in it.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lauren O’Neill is a culture writer</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Here’s what experts say.</p> <h2>What is creatine?</h2> <p>Creatine is a compound the body naturally makes in the liver, kidneys and pancreas. We can also get it from animal proteins like red meat, fish and chicken. It acts as a quick fuel source for muscles, helping regenerate adenosine triphosphate, or ATP – a molecule cells use for energy.</p> <p>“If we keep it super simple, the body has three sorts of energy systems,” says Dr Imtiaz Desai, a Sydney, Australia-based exercise physiologist.</p> <p>Creatine helps power short-duration, high-intensity activities like sprinting or lifting, and also those requiring moderately sustained energy, like tennis or hockey. But it doesn’t do much for prolonged, slow-burn energy like the kind you need to run a marathon.</p> <p>If you’re doing resistance training, it helps muscles work harder for a little longer. “It should enable you to do a few more repetitions at the same weight,” says Desai.</p> <p>Most people don’t need creatine supplements for general health – the body makes enough, aside from in rare and serious <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3794/\">cases</a> of genetic creatine deficiency disorder. Nonetheless, the fitness-minded often take it to optimize their workouts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\" data-alt=\"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ \"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Synthetic creatine comes in different formulations, but creatine monohydrate is the most studied, with the strongest evidence for efficacy. It’s widely available, often sold as a flavorless, grainy white powder, and affordable: dosages vary based on personal goals, but a typical daily serving of five grams might cost about 50 cents (38p).</p> <h2><strong>Is creatine safe?</strong></h2> <p>In healthy adults, creatine is considered safe even for <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2025.1578564/full\">long-term</a> use – it’s one of the most <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8949037/\">researched</a> supplements available.</p> <p>While the UK regulates dietary supplements, in the US, the Food and Drug Administration does not vet the accuracy of supplement contents, so it’s possible for products to be contaminated with other substances or contain less creatine than advertised. Products with the <a href=\"https://www.nsf.org/knowledge-library/what-is-nsf-certification\">NSF seal</a> are more reliable, as they have been tested by a third-party certifier.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/12/do-you-feel-proud-when-you-succeed\">Do you feel proud when you succeed – or just relieved?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Creatine is known to cause minor side-effects like bloating or stomach pain. These can be more pronounced in people taking higher doses, such as 25 or 30 grams a day, in a dubious practice known as “<a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/creatine-loading-phase\">loading</a>”.</p> <p>“There’s no need for a loading phase,” says Dr Avinish Reddy, a Los Angeles-based physician with a longevity-focused practice.</p> <p>Higher doses of creatine create more waste for the kidneys to filter, so people with kidney issues should check with a doctor before starting the supplement, says Reddy. Recently, creatine “loading” was linked to <a href=\"https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6264415/v1\">acute kidney injury</a> in a 17-year-old boy.</p> <p>It’s best to take creatine mixed into a liquid, like juice, water or a smoothie, as opposed to “dry-scooping”, an influencer stunt in which people eat straight creatine. This method <a href=\"https://www.garagegymreviews.com/can-you-dry-scoop-creatine\">risks powder inhalation and choking</a>, along with worse GI effects.</p> <h2>Does creatine actually help build muscle?</h2> <p>The short answer: not as much as the hype suggests.</p> <p>Desai led a 12-week <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/6/1081\">study</a>, published this March, in which two groups of people began a weight-lifting regimen. One group used creatine, the other did not. There was no meaningful difference in results: people in both groups gained approximately two kilograms of lean body mass on average.</p> <p>In the short term, creatine draws water into muscles, which can cause a couple of pounds of temporary weight gain and make muscles look more full. “There’s a short-term change in body-water content,” says Desai, who posits that past <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10180745/\">studies</a> that found small benefits with creatine supplementation may have overestimated creatine’s relationship with muscle growth by not accounting for this water retention.</p> <p>Desai says it’s possible that longer studies might provide more information about creatine’s muscle-building benefits over time. It is also possible that creatine may indirectly boost muscle growth by allowing people to train harder. “If you’re able to do more repetitions, then over time, we would expect you to see an added benefit,” Desai says.</p> <p>But don’t expect an overnight change. “You’re not going to pack on pounds of muscle within a few weeks,” he says, nor will adding creatine to an otherwise sedentary lifestyle yield results.</p> <h2>Who benefits most from creatine?</h2> <p>Creatine is often associated with athletes looking for an edge, but supplementation also can be helpful for older adults experiencing muscle loss. “Women experience a lot of muscle mass and strength loss after menopause,” says Reddy, who often recommends a standard daily dose of three to five grams of creatine to patients. It can help with resistance training and post-workout <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34199588/\">recovery</a> by activating satellite cells, which repair muscle fibers after injury caused by use.</p> <p>Vegetarians and vegans who supplement with creatine may also see greater improvements in their workouts and energy levels, since their diets contain less natural creatine.</p> <p>However, researchers estimate that about 20%-30% of people are “<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15320650/\">non-responders</a>” to creatine due to physiological factors like genetics.</p> <h2>Can creatine support mental health?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-020-0741-x#Sec9\">Researchers</a> are exploring whether creatine may help ease depression symptoms by <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1424972/full\">supporting</a> brain energy, memory, attention and information processing speed, and promoting <a href=\"https://www.psychiatrypodcast.com/psychiatry-psychotherapy-podcast/episode-238-creatine-mental-health-benefits\">dopamine and serotonin</a> production.</p> <p>Dr David Puder, Florida-based psychiatrist and host of the Psychiatry &amp; Psychotherapy podcast, sees creatine as a promising tool in treating depression. It is not necessarily a standalone solution, but can be part of a broader, physician-led approach to treating depression, along with therapy and optimizing diet, exercise and sleep.</p> <p>“Studies to date have shown that creatine seems to amplify the speed at which people recover [from depression] by a little bit,” says Puder. “Not a lot, but a measurable improvement,” he says, particularly in clinical trials pairing creatine with medications such as Lexapro or cognitive behavioral therapy.</p> <p>It may be that creatine’s exercise-boosting effects also support mental health. “Exercise improves the ability to come out of depression,” says Puder, so better workouts “may allow for an independent improvement in depression beyond what the creatine is doing in the brain”.</p> <p>While creatine may help alleviate the mental fatigue that comes with depression, Puder says that in people with bipolar disorder, there is some risk of it contributing to hypomania. If you are interested in starting creatine, you should talk to your doctor beforehand.</p> <h2>Is creatine safe for young people?</h2> <p>While creatine itself is generally safe for adults, most medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, <a href=\"https://health.choc.org/should-teens-use-creatine/\">recommend against</a> creatine use for those under 18 due to unknown long-term effects. However, there are no age restrictions on who can buy creatine, and a 2024 <a href=\"https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a62567487/should-teens-take-supplements/\">review</a> found 26% of adolescent boys said they had taken creatine at some point.</p> <p>The University of Toronto researcher Dr Kyle Ganson also cautions that creatine use by teens can be part of a broader pattern.</p> <p>Ganson recently <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39173400/\">studied</a> a cohort of 912 teenagers and young adults. He found that those who used creatine, particularly young men and boys, were more likely to develop muscle dysmorphia – an obsessive drive for size and muscularity that can lead to psychological fallout.</p> <p>“It’s not causal,” says Ganson. “Just because you take creatine, you’re not going to develop a mental health condition.” But it may be a sign that a young person is becoming overly focused on body image.</p> <p>Ganson urges parents to exercise “respectful curiosity” about their child’s goals with the supplement, and to talk to a doctor or dietitian, especially if their child’s focus on physical appearance seems to be disrupting other areas of their life.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 16 May 2025 to describe NSF as a certifier, rather than a regulator.</p>","source":"The Guardian","author":""}],"hasMore":true,"currentPage":1,"category":"Nutrition"}
