There is a stupid girl who wants to make a website on the topics of health and beauty. Now what she wants to do is that she wants to show content related to health and beauty which can genuinely help people and current data is required by her. So, what we need is to create a PRD, FRS, and SRS of such a web app so that when this app gets deployed, the content gets dynamically updated every day without this stupid girl to change the content every day and stuff like that. So you need to do research on free APIs that we can integrate in our next JS project and you have to research on each and everything so that when the AI agentic coder is going to read the PRD, FRS, and SRS documents, then the AI coder just simply does this without any issues. You have to decide on the UI, the UX, the functionalities, and stuff like that and I don't think any backend is required in this. So please do the honors and do this perfectly and find the perfect APIs and stuff like that that we can use as it is so that her stuff gets done perfectly. Thank you. This stupid girl also said that under the articles and stuff like that, the videos related to such articles automatically get embedded from YouTube. And if that is needed, I mean, if there is no way to do such a thing, then we can also find the related videos and just give the embed codes somewhere in the application and when those embed codes are provided, the videos related to the article gets shown there and the users read the article and then they watch the related video and it must all be presented in a way so that the user gets engaged on the website on a very deep level and appreciates the stuff. As it must be genuinely valuable and helpful to them. Thank you.

Now I have comprehensive understanding of both Google Stitch and your master specification. Let me create the perfect prompt for Google Stitch to generate the design of your health and beauty website.

Research Summary: Google Stitch
Google Stitch is an AI-powered UI design tool by Google Labs that generates designs from text prompts and reference images. It has two modes:

Standard Mode (Gemini 2.5 Flash):

350 generations per month
Optimized for speed and quick iterations
Direct Figma export capability
Text-to-UI generation
Experimental Mode (Gemini 2.5 Pro):

50 generations per month
Higher quality, detailed designs
Sketch-to-UI generation
Better for complex layouts
Perfect Prompt for Google Stitch

Start with Standard Mode for initial generations (350/month vs 50)
2.
Use the detailed prompt above - be specific about layout, colors, and components
3.
Iterate and Refine - if first result isn't perfect, use the chat feature to adjust
4.
Export to Figma - once satisfied, paste into Figma for further refinement
5.
Mobile Priority - Google Stitch excels at mobile-first designs
Recommended Workflow:
1.
Generate Homepage first using the detailed prompt
2.
Generate key sections (Health, Beauty, Nutrition pages)
3.
Create component variations if needed
4.
Export to Figma for final adjustments
5.
Use in development as reference for your AI coder
The prompt above includes all the specific details from your master specification: the color palette, typography system, component library specifications, responsive breakpoints, and the exact layout requirements. This should give Google Stitch everything it needs to create designs that match your envisioned application.

This is what has been generated as of now. Do you want to give a follow up prompt as per your plan?

The designs have been generated for your HealthBeauty Hub website:

Homepage: This responsive homepage features a sticky header, a prominent hero section with a gradient background and featured article, and quick access cards.

Perfect! Yes, let's give Google Stitch a follow-up prompt to fix that footer year issue and make any other refinements needed.

Follow-up Prompt for Google Stitch
Here's the perfect follow-up prompt to correct the footer and make any final improvements:

FOLLOW-UP PROMPT:

Please update and refine the HealthBeauty Hub website designs with the following corrections and improvements:

FOOTER CORRECTION:
- Update all footer copyright text to show "© 2026 HealthBeauty Hub. All rights reserved." 
- Ensure consistency across all pages (Homepage, Health, Beauty, Nutrition, Videos sections)
- Make sure the footer is clean, minimal, and professional

ADDITIONAL DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS:
- Ensure all text is readable with proper contrast ratios for WCAG 2.2 AA compliance
- Verify that all touch targets are minimum 44px for mobile accessibility
- Add subtle hover states to interactive elements (cards, buttons, navigation)
- Ensure consistent spacing and alignment across all sections
- Optimize the hero section layout - make sure the headline text is large and prominent
- Check that the navigation bar remains sticky on scroll
- Ensure the mobile hamburger menu is clearly visible and functional

SPECIFIC LAYOUT REFINEMENTS:
- Homepage: Make sure the three quick access cards (🏥 Health, 💄 Beauty, 🥗 Nutrition) have clear color differentiation (teal, pink, amber borders)
- Health Section: Ensure article grid is responsive (4-2-1 columns on desktop, stacked on mobile)
- Beauty Section: Verify product cards show images, names, and clear pricing
- Nutrition Section: Make sure nutrition data is visually clear and well-organized
- Video Section: Ensure YouTube thumbnails are properly sized with play button overlays

YEAR CONSISTENCY:
- Change any date references from 2024/2023 to 2026
- Update current year displays to 2026
- Ensure all temporal references align with 2026

Please regenerate all screens with these corrections while maintaining the overall modern, clean aesthetic and mobile-first responsive design.
Why This Follow-up Prompt Works:
1.
Specific Footer Fix: Directly addresses the year issue
2.
Accessibility Compliance: Reminds about WCAG standards
3.
Interactive Elements: Emphasizes hover states and touch targets
4.
Layout Consistency: Ensures proper grid systems and spacing
5.
Color Differentiation: Maintains the teal/pink/amber color scheme
6.
Mobile Optimization: Focuses on responsive behavior
7.
Year Consistency: General check for any 2024/2023 references
This follow-up should help Google Stitch correct the footer year issue while enhancing the overall design quality and ensuring it matches your master specification requirements perfectly.

🚀 Recommended Next Steps:
Option 1: Export to Figma for Further Refinement
In Google Stitch:
1. Copy each design screen
2. Paste directly into Figma
3. Fine-tune spacing, typography, and interactions
4. Create design system components
5. Add final branding elements
Option 2: Export HTML/CSS Code
In Google Stitch:
1. Use "Export Code" feature for each section
2. Get clean HTML/CSS that matches the designs
3. Use as starting code for your AI coder
4. Enhance with your master specification details
Option 3: Proceed to Development
Use designs as visual reference for AI coder:
1. Provide Google Stitch design screenshots
2. Reference master implementation specification
3. Let AI coder build exact designs with full functionality
4. Include all API integrations and dynamic features
My Recommendation:
I suggest Option 3 - proceed directly to development. The designs are now perfect and capture exactly what's in your master specification. Your AI coder can use both:

Google Stitch design screenshots as visual reference
MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_SPECIFICATION.md as the complete technical guide
This approach will give you the fastest path to a fully functional website that matches these beautiful designs.

Which option would you prefer to pursue?

So, I am going to use google ai studio app builder to make this. I am going to atatch the mastyerspecification file in form of a txt file and also atatch the extracted mockups from google stich. Yoiu are my prompt provider and project orchestartor. You will not provide any code and all just prompts tailored for the google ai studio  app builder so that it can make all this with pereftcion.

Heyyy, aren't you missing something? We have the designs with us which we made from google stitch. For each screen we have the HTML code file and the png file with us. We should use them. I get it why you didn't use the master specification file you created after rigorous research as it contained code that might be faulty. SO, give the prompts and we have to use the designs that were made my google stitch.
